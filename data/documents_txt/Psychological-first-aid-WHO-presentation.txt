Crisis Events 
• Crisis events – both large-scale and individual 
– occur in every community in the world  
– Large-scale events include natural disasters, war 
and terrorist attacks, disease outbreaks, large-
scale displacement of people and communities 
– Individual events affect one or a few people, such 
as accidents, robbery, assault 
• They have physical, social and emotional 
consequences for those affected 
PFA: First-Line Psychosocial Support 
• PFA is important, first-line psychosocial support 
for people affected by crisis events  
– PFA, like medical “first aid”, is not enough on its own   
• Immediately after a crisis event, those who assist 
are often family members, neighbors, teachers, 
community members and first responders of 
various kinds (emergency medical teams, police, 
firefighters) 
• Term “PFA” was first coined in the 1940s but its 
use has increased in modern-day crisis events

What is PFA? 
Humane, supportive & practical assistance to fellow 
human beings who recently suffered a serious stressor: 
• Non-intrusive, practical care and support 
• Assessing needs and concerns 
• Helping people to address basic needs (food, water) 
• Listening, but not pressuring people to talk 
• Comforting people and helping them to feel calm 
• Helping people connect to information, services and 
social supports 
• Protecting people from further harm 
 
What PFA is NOT? 
• NOT something only professionals can do 
• NOT professional counselling  
• NOT a clinical or psychiatric intervention (although 
can be part of good clinical care) 
• NOT “psychological debriefing” 
• NOT asking people to analyze what happened or put 
time and events in order 
• NOT pressuring people to tell you their story, or 
asking details about how they feel or what happened 
Why PFA? 
 
• People do better over 
the long term if they… 
– Feel safe, connected to 
others, calm & hopeful 
– Have access to social, 
physical & emotional 
support 
– Regain a sense of 
control by being able to 
help themselves 
PFA: Who, When, Where? 
• Who can benefit from PFA? 
– Boys, girls, women and men who have recently 
experienced a crisis event and are distressed 
– Some people need more than PFA alone such as 
people with life-threatening injuries or unable to care 
for themselves or their children 
• When should PFA be provided? 
– When encountering a person in distress, usually 
immediately following a crisis event 
• Where should PFA be provided? 
– Anywhere that is safe for the helper and affected 
person, ideally with some privacy as appropriate to 
the situation 
How to Help Responsibly 
• Adapt what you do to take account of the person’s 
culture 
• Respect safety, dignity and rights 
– Safety:  don’t expose people to further harm, ensure (as best 
you can) they are safe and protected from further physical or 
psychological harm 
– Dignity:  treat people with respect and according to their 
cultural and social norms 
– Rights:  act only in people’s best interest, ensure access to 
impartial assistance without discrimination, assist people to 
claim their rights and access available support 
• Be aware of other emergency response measures 
• Care for caregivers: practice self-care and team-care

Good Communication:   
Things to Say and Do 
•
Try to find a quiet place to talk and 
minimize outside distractions. 
•
Stay near the person but keep an 
appropriate distance depending on 
their age, gender and culture. 
•
Let them know you hear what they 
are saying, for example, nod your 
head and stay attentive 
•
Be patient and calm. 
•
Provide factual information IF you 
have it.  Be honest about what you 
know and what you don’t know.  “I 
don’t know but I will try to find out 
about that for you.” 
•
Give information in a way the 
person can understand - keep it 
simple. 
•
Acknowledge how they are 
feeling, and any losses or 
important events they share with 
you, such as loss of home or 
death of a loved one.  “I’m so 
sorry…” 
•
Respect privacy.  Keep the 
person’s story confidential, 
especially when they disclose 
very private events.

strengths and how they have 
helped themselves.
