What is Sleep Hygiene? 
 
‘Sleep hygiene’ is the term used to describe good sleep habits. 
Considerable research has gone into developing a set of 
guidelines and tips which are designed to enhance good 
sleeping, and there is much evidence to suggest that these 
strategies can provide long-term solutions to sleep difficulties.  
 
There are many medications which are used to treat insomnia, 
but these tend to be only effective in the short-term. Ongoing 
use of sleeping pills may lead to dependence and interfere 
with developing good sleep habits independent of medication, 
thereby prolonging sleep difficulties. Talk to your health 
professional about what is right for you, but we recommend 
good sleep hygiene as an important part of treating insomnia, 
either with other strategies such as medication or cognitive 
therapy or alone. 
 
Sleep Hygiene Tips 
1) Get regular. One of the best ways to train your body to 
sleep well is to go to bed and get up at more or less the 
same time every day, even on weekends and days off! This 
regular rhythm will make you feel better and will give your 
body something to work from. 
2) Sleep when sleepy. Only try to sleep when you actually 
feel tired or sleepy, rather than spending too much time 
awake in bed. 
3) Get up & try again. If you haven’t been able to get to 
sleep after about 20 minutes or more, get up and do 
something calming or boring until you feel sleepy, then 
return to bed and try again. Sit quietly on the couch with 
the lights off (bright light will tell your brain that it is time 
to wake up), or read something boring like the phone 
book. Avoid doing anything that is too stimulating or 
interesting, as this will wake you up even more. 
4) Avoid caffeine & nicotine. It is best to avoid consuming 
any caffeine (in coffee, tea, cola drinks, chocolate, and 
some medications) or nicotine (cigarettes) for at least 4-6 
hours before going to bed. These substances act as 
stimulants and interfere with the ability to fall asleep 
5) Avoid alcohol. It is also best to avoid 
alcohol for at least 4-6 hours before going to 
bed. Many people believe that alcohol is 
relaxing and helps them to get to sleep at 
first, but it actually interrupts the quality of 
sleep. 
6) Bed is for sleeping. Try not to use your bed 
for anything other than sleeping and sex, so that your body 
comes to associate bed with sleep. If you use bed as a 
place to watch TV, eat, read, work on your laptop, pay 
bills, and other things, your body will not learn this 
connection.

7) No naps. It is best to avoid taking naps 
during the day, to make sure that you 
are tired at bedtime. If you can’t make it 
through the day without a nap, make 
sure it is for less than an hour and 
before 3pm. 
8) Sleep rituals. You can develop your own rituals of things to 
remind your body that it is time to sleep - some people find 
it useful to do relaxing stretches or breathing exercises for 
15 minutes before bed each night, or sit calmly with a cup of 
caffeine-free tea. 
9) Bathtime. Having a hot bath 1-2 hours before bedtime can 
be useful, as it will raise your body temperature, causing you 
to feel sleepy as your body temperature drops again. 
Research shows that sleepiness is associated with a drop in 
body temperature. 
10) No clock-watching. Many people who struggle with sleep 
tend to watch the clock too much. Frequently checking the 
clock during the night can wake you up (especially if you turn 
on the light to read the time) and reinforces negative 
thoughts such as “Oh no, look how late it is, I’ll never get to 
sleep” or “it’s so early, I have only slept for 5 hours, this is 
terrible.” 
11) Use a sleep diary. This worksheet can be a useful way of 
making sure you have the right facts about your sleep, rather 
than making assumptions. Because a diary involves watching 
the clock (see point 10) it is a good idea to only use it for 
two weeks to get an idea of what is going and then 
perhaps two months down the track to see how you 
are progressing.   
12) Exercise. Regular exercise is a good idea to 
help with good sleep, but try not to do strenuous 
exercise in the 4 hours before bedtime. Morning 
walks are a great way to start the day feeling refreshed! 
13) Eat right. A healthy, balanced diet will help you to sleep 
well, but timing is important. Some people find that a very 
empty stomach at bedtime is distracting, so it can be useful 
to have a light snack, but a heavy meal soon before bed can 
also interrupt sleep. Some people recommend a warm glass 
of milk, which contains tryptophan, which acts as a natural 
sleep inducer.  
14) The right space. It is very important that your bed and 
bedroom are quiet and comfortable for sleeping. A cooler 
room with enough blankets to stay warm is best, and make 
sure you have curtains or an eyemask to block out early 
morning light and earplugs if there is noise outside your 
room. 
15) Keep daytime routine the same. Even if you have a bad 
night sleep and are tired it is important that you  try to keep 
your daytime activities the same as you had planned. That is, 
don’t avoid activities because you feel tired. This can 
reinforce the insomnia.
