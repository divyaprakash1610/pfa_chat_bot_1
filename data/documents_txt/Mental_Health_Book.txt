I
t is now recognised that most 
mental disorders begin during 
youth (12–24 years of age), 
although they are often first 
detected later in life. These disorders 
will stay with them into adulthood. 
Poor mental health is strongly related 
to other health and development 
concerns in young people, notably 
lower educational achievements, 
substance misuse, and violence. 
Mental health issues are therefore 
increasingly recognised as a priority 
area among students. Without an 
early intervention to address these 
mental health challenges, the impact 
on society could be great.
Foreword
An effective response to addressing 
mental health disorders among 
youth is essential for the future 
of the world because, according 
to the United Nations Population 
Fund, with 1.8 billion youth, “the 
largest generation of young people 
in human history is coming of 
age” (United Nations Population 
Fund 2014). Currently, we have the 
largest generation of 10- to 24-year-
olds in human history and mental 
health disorders among youth lead 
to tremendous suffering (morbidity) 
and early death.
One key 
known barrier 
is the early 
identification 
and prevention 
of youth mental 
health disorders 
Despite these facts being known, 
very little is being done to counter 
this pending mental health crisis. 
The barriers to provision for 
iv
Mental Health Handbook For University Students 
youth mental health disorders can 
be overcome. One key known 
barrier is the early identification 
and prevention of youth mental 
health disorders. These include low 
rates of help-seeking, the limited 
capacity of existing services to 
respond, and the fact that health 
systems are not suited to young 
people’s needs.  Researchers note 
that young people fear stigma and 
embarrassment, they have problems 
recognising symptoms (poor mental 
health literacy) and prefer self-
reliance, and that these are the most 
important barriers to help-seeking. 
Some factors that help make youth 
seek assistance for mental disorders 
include positive past experiences 
(with health care service provision), 
social support, and encouragement 
from others.
With 
mental 
health 
receiving 
increasing attention amongst youth 
and young adults, this very timely 
handbook is a critical tool in the 
promotion of the mental well-being 
of university students. Written in an 
engaging manner, Bester Nyang’wa 
has gone a long way to make mental 
health issues more accessible to the 
readers of this important handbook. 
It serves as a great starter kit written 
in simple language void of technical 
jargon. It addresses issues pertinent 
to any university student and nicely 
unpacks complex terms. The author 
offers some tips and techniques to 
address some of these challenges 
and is a good go-to start-up before 
seeking professional help should 
self-treatments prove ineffective. 
The book gives a list of contacts 
to enable one to find the required 
professional help in the Malawi 
context. Read it, practice what you 
read and keep it close by. It is a good 
basic introduction to the important 
field of mental health!

elcome to the “Mental Health for University Students 
Handbook,” a resource crafted to address the unique mental 
health challenges faced by university students. In these pages, 
we will explore vital topics and themes designed to support 
students in fostering their mental well-being. This handbook emerged from 
part of the findings of a study that I conducted on “Mental Health Awareness 
and Help-seeking Among University Students: A Case Study of Malawi 
University of Business and Applied Sciences – MUBAS”. The inspiration 
was drawn from the wide-ranging literature reviewed, which revealed the 
prevalence of mental health issues among students, preceded by low help-
seeking due to among other things; lack of awareness, stigma and. Self-
reliance and embarrassment. Furthermore, I have personally witnessed 
the prevalence of mental health challenges among the youth. Fuelled by a 
commitment to provide actionable resources, this handbook is a response 
to the urgent need for comprehensive knowledge and support. Although 
designed specifically for university students, the insights and strategies of 
this handbook can benefit anyone navigating the complexities of mental 
health. 
The handbook begins by emphasising the importance of mental health to the 
university experience. Subsequent chapters delve into defining mental health, 
dispelling misconceptions, and addressing stigmas. It examines factors 
influencing mental health, discusses common issues, and offers practical 
coping strategies. The inclusion of case studies and personal stories adds a 
human touch, reinforcing key points. To effectively utilise this handbook, 
I encourage readers to explore specific sections based on their needs (by 
referring to the table of contents). Readers will also find information 
about additional resources and support services, including helplines, and 
community resources. It is envisaged that this handbook will serve as a 
beacon of understanding and support, not only for university students but for 
anyone who comes across its pages. 
This “Mental Health Handbook” is more than a guide; it’s a companion in 
your journey towards mental well-being. While this handbook aims to be

a comprehensive resource, it may not cover every aspect of mental health, 
and individual experiences may vary. Therefore, in addition to the guidance 
offered within these pages, I strongly advocate seeking professional help 
when faced with mental health challenges. Together, let’s work towards a 
future where understanding, compassion, and proactive mental health care 
define our university communities.

Importance of mental health to university students. 
So! First and foremost, I just want to say that your presence here at university 
means you made it among hundreds of thousands, and allow me to say this 
out loud: congratulations!!! Iweyo! ndi Dolo! Aise!!! (You are a star). Here 
at university, several things about your life matter a lot for you to succeed 
in your everyday life including academic endeavours. One of them is your 
mental health. Quiet a strange term? Don’t worry about that. We are here 
to break this down together and we will surely do that shortly, but for now, 
let’s dive a bit deeper into why mental health is such a big deal for you as a 
university student. 
As a university student, you require good mental health if you are to achieve 
your goals, just like you require good physical health. Think of mental health 
as the compass guiding your journey through academic challenges, social

interactions, and personal growth. You can’t go to class with malaria or a bad 
flu just like you can’t go to class let alone concentrate on your studies with 
an unhealthy mind. Maintaining good mental health means you’re equipped 
to tackle those tough assignments with clarity, navigate the maze of social 
dynamics, and nurture your well-being as you evolve during your university 
years. In essence, it’s like having a reliable support system for this adventure 
called university life. 
Statistics on mental health issues among students
Young people’s mental health is a major public health issue. Mental health 
problems among young people contribute to impaired physical and mental 
health extending into adulthood (Bor et al., 2014). Globally, one in seven 
10-19-year-olds experiences a mental disorder, accounting for 13% of the 
global burden of disease in this age group (WHO, 2021). Depression, anxiety, 
and behavioural issues are primary contributors to disorders and disability. 
A systematic review of studies from Sub-Saharan African countries 
encompassing a total population of 97,616 adolescents found the following 
prevalence estimates; 40.8% for emotional and behavioural problems, 29.8% 
for anxiety disorders, 26.9% for depression, 21.5% for Post-Traumatic Stress 
Disorder (PTSD), and 20.8% for suicidal thoughts (Jörns-Presentati et al., 
2021). 
Suicide (which we shall discuss in detail later) stands as the fourth leading 
cause of death among 15-29-year-olds globally (WHO, 2023), emphasising 
the critical need to address adolescent mental health early to prevent lasting 
impacts on both physical and mental well-being, and hindered opportunities 
for fulfilling adulthood.
In Malawi, prevalence rates of common mental disorders like depression 
and anxiety among youth range from 10 - 30% (Jumbe et al., 2023), with an 
existing treatment gap of around 90% in the population (Kim et al., 2014). 
These statistics, however, are in no way an indication that mental health 
problems cannot be overcome. Like any other ailment, mental disorders are 
preventable and treatable. If you have read up to this point, then you are 
halfway to becoming someone who can overcome mental challenges as well 
as help those in need. So, let’s keep going!

Mental Health Handbook For University Students 
Definition of mental health
To adequately understand “mental health” let us first have a clear understanding 
of “health” in general. The World Health Organization (WHO, 2023) defines 
health as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not 
merely the absence of disease or sickness. This is to say; being healthy is 
not just about not suffering from ailments such as malaria. It is possible for 
you not to be suffering from any physical disorders but still be unhealthy. 
How? This is where the aspect of “mental health” comes in. The adjective 
“mental” describes anything having to do with the mind, just as “physical” 
has to do with the body. While mental health encompasses aspects associated 
with the intellect, mind, and brain, it extends far beyond these dimensions. In 
addition to cognitive functions, mental health includes emotions, behaviours, 
and the choices individuals make. Moreover, there is a social component 
involving peer influence and societal acceptability, broadening the scope of 
II.	   UNDERSTANDING MENTAL 	  
	
  HEALTH
A sound mind is crucial for navigating university life successfully
4
Mental Health Handbook For University Students 
mental health beyond the confines of intellectual considerations. “Mental 
health is a state of mental well-being that enables people to cope with the 
everyday stresses of life, realise their abilities, learn well and work well, 
and contribute to their community” (World Health Organisation [WHO] fact 
sheet, 2022). Mental health is a key part of our overall health and well-being. 
It’s the foundation that helps us make choices, build relationships, and shape 
the world around us, both individually and as a group. Think of it as a basic 
right for every person, and it is something everyone should have. Plus, it’s 
super important for personal growth, building communities, and making 
society better overall. Mental health is therefore more than the absence of 
mental disorders. Wait a minute! Did we discuss mental disorders? I don’t 
think we did. That’s nothing to worry about anyway. Think about a mental 
disorder as a sickness/disease to the mind/brain, as is malaria or diarrhoea to 
the body. The American Psychiatric Association – APA (2024) defines mental 
disorders as “health conditions involving changes in emotion, thinking or 
behaviour (or a combination of these)”. Now let’s get back to why mental 
health is important to you as a student. 
Why mental health matters
Mental health problems can affect many areas of your life as a student, 
reducing the quality of your life (the overall well-being and satisfaction 
you experience across various aspects of your existence/being in this

world and being on campus), academic achievement, physical health, and 
satisfaction with the university experience. Mental health problems can also 
negatively impact your relationships with friends as well as family members. 
These issues can also have long-term consequences, affecting your future 
employment, earning potential, and overall health (Eisenberg et al., 2007).
While mental health is a concern for everyone, students occupy a particularly 
significant realm in this regard (Hernandez-Torrano et al., 2020). Uplifting 
your mental well-being is paramount, as it directly correlates with your 
academic performance and the realisation of your full potential (Agnafors et 
al., 2020). Beyond academics, fostering positive mental health will equip you 
with the capacity to form meaningful relationships, make sound decisions, 
and collaborate effectively. These positive outcomes extend not only to you 
as a student but also resonate within your broader community e.g. family, 
neighbourhood and even here at university.
Mental health disorder and mental health illness
Frequently, we use the terms mental illness and mental disorder 
interchangeably to mean a mental condition that we have been/someone has 
been diagnosed/found with. However, these terms carry distinct meanings.
Mental disorder
When defining a mental disorder, the United States National Institutes of 
Health (NIH) describes it as “a disturbance of normal functioning of the 
mind or body,” with causes ranging from genetic factors and disease to 
trauma. While the term “disorder” encompasses conditions affecting both 
the body and mind, it has become somewhat outdated. In the past, experts 
were unaware that mental disorders could impact the brain rather than solely 
the mind (National Institutes of Health, 2022).
The term in more common use today is mental illness, as it more accurately 
reflects that psychiatric conditions can affect more than just the “mind.” 
Additionally, “disorder” holds a negative connotation, while “illness” 
encourages people to envision someone grappling with a medical condition 
which can be prevented, managed or treated.
Mental illness
As per the United States’ Centre for Disease Control – CDC (2023), mental 
illness pertains to conditions that affect a person’s thinking, feeling, mood, or 
behaviour. In contrast to the term “mental disorder,” this phrase incorporates 
language implying that mental health conditions extend beyond just the 
mind. Examples of mental illnesses encompass depression, anxiety disorders, 
schizophrenia, and more (Centres for Disease Control and Prevention 
- CDC, 2023). Although many doctors use the terms mental disorder and 
mental illness interchangeably, mental illness is the accurate term to depict 
psychiatric conditions. 
Common misconceptions and stigmas
I am sure you have come across a lot of information about mental health and 
disorders, and chances are, you might have some beliefs implanted into your 
thoughts. But here’s the thing: most, of what you’ve heard is either partially 
true or completely false. 
6
Mental Health Handbook For University Students 
Now, let’s expose some myths, clarify misconceptions, and shed light on 
the aspects of mental health that are often misunderstood, with a focus on 
addressing the most common misconceptions.
Misconceptions fuel stigma
Misconception # 1: Mental health issues cannot affect me.  
Firstly, let’s agree on something we all share: nobody wants to be sick. 
This is the same with mental health. Most people never imagine themselves 
struggling with it. A widespread misconception revolves around the idea that 
mental disorders selectively affect certain demographics, be it individuals of 
a specific age group, social class, gender, or any other defining characteristic. 
However, just like any other disorders such as malaria, diabetes, typhoid 
etc., mental disorders do not discriminate; they can affect anyone regardless 
of age, gender, geography, income, social status, race, ethnicity, religion/
spirituality, sexual orientation, background or other aspects of cultural 
identity (American Psychiatric Association, 2024).
Misconception/Myth # 2: Mental health issues are a result of personal 
weakness.
Just like physical ailments such as cough, flu, malaria etc., mental health 
conditions have nothing to do with being lazy or weak. Many factors 
contribute to mental health conditions, including:
•	
Biological factors, such as genes, physical disorders, injury, or brain 
chemistry
•	
Life experiences, such as trauma or a history of abuse
•	
Family history of mental health conditions
Misconception/Myth # 3: Mental disorders are untreatable. 
Studies show that people with mental health conditions get better and 
many are on a path to recovery (United States Substance Abuse and Mental 
Health Services Administration [SAMHASA], 2023). Recovery refers to the 
process in which people can live, work, learn, and participate fully in their 
communities. There are more treatments, services, and community support 
systems and they work. With the right kind of help, treated appropriately and 
early, most people recover fully and have no further episodes of illness. For 
others, mental illness may recur throughout their lives and require ongoing 
treatment. This is the same as many physical illnesses, such as diabetes and 
7
Mental Health Handbook For University Students 
heart disease. Like these other long-term health conditions, mental illness 
can be managed so that individuals live life to the fullest.
Misconception/Myth # 4: People with a mental illness are violent/
dangerous.
This incorrect belief forms the basis for some of the most harmful stereotypes 
about individuals with mental illness. Those facing mental health challenges 
are seldom a threat, even those with severe conditions that might lead to 
unusual behaviour; the likelihood of them being dangerous is exceptionally 
low. The majority of individuals with mental health conditions are no more 
prone to violence than the general population.
Only 3%–5% of violent acts can be linked to individuals dealing with a severe 
mental illness (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 
[SAMHSA], 2023). Interestingly, those with significant mental health 
challenges are more than ten times more likely to become victims of violent 
crimes compared to the overall population. It is quite probable that you 
know someone with a mental health condition without even realising it, as 
many individuals facing such challenges actively contribute as productive 
members of our communities.
Misconception/Myth # 5: Mental Illness is caused by witchcraft.
Mental illness is not caused by bewitchment. Mental health conditions 
have complex origins, often involving a combination of genetic, biological, 
environmental, and psychological factors (National Institute of Mental 
Health – NIMH (2022). Attributing mental illness solely to bewitchment 
perpetuates stigma and hinders individuals from seeking appropriate and 
evidence-based mental health care. 
Misconception/Myth # 6: A person with a mental illness can help 
themselves out of it.
Since mental illness is not caused by personal weakness, it is unlikely or 
more difficult to be ‘cured’ by personal strength. Being strong on your own 
doesn’t fix it (SA Health, 2024). It is the same as expecting someone to cure 
themselves of Malaria simply because they are strong. You need more than 
just strength. Getting better usually means getting help from professionals, 
8
Mental Health Handbook For University Students 
talking to someone, and at times using medicine. Asking for help doesn’t 
mean you’re weak; it means you’re doing what it takes to feel better.
Misconception/Myth # 7: There’s nothing you can do for a person with 
mental illness.
If someone shows signs (which we will expose later) of mental illness, have 
an open and honest discussion with him or her about your concerns. You 
may not be able to force someone to get professional care, but you can offer 
encouragement and support (Health Direct, 2024). The support of friends 
and loved ones plays a crucial role in one’s mental health journey. 
The spectrum of mental health (From well-being to mental disorders)
Think of mental health as a spectrum, similar to how we see physical health. 
On one end, you have the feeling of being ok, like when you’re full of energy, 
happy, and able to handle everyday challenges. That’s like being in great 
physical shape and without any illness (minor or major), where you feel 
strong and ready for anything. In the middle of the mental health spectrum, 
you might have days when you’re okay but not at your best. It’s like when 
you have a minor flu or a little headache. You can still do your usual stuff like 
take a bath on your own, make yourself breakfast, go to class, wash clothes 
etc., but you’re not 100% alright.
On the other end of the mental health spectrum, there might be times when 
things feel tough. It’s like when you’re physically unwell, perhaps with a 
more serious illness such as malaria. You might need some extra support to 
get back to feeling better (e.g. visit the clinic and get some medication). So, 
mental health is like physical health, it can vary for everyone, and where you 
are on the spectrum can change. The goal is to move towards feeling good 
and, if needed, get the right support, just like you would for your physical 
health.

Academic pressure: A leading source of stress for students
Academic pressure
Academic pressure is a significant factor that can negatively impact your 
mental health (Steare, et al., 2023). The pressure to perform well academically 
can be overwhelming, especially if you are pursuing a demanding field. This 
pressure can lead to stress, anxiety, and depression, which can affect your 
ability to focus, learn and pass examinations.
Social challenges
Social challenges are another factor that can affect your mental health. You 
may experience difficulty making friends, feeling isolated, or dealing with 
III.	   FACTORS AFFECTING MENTAL 
	
  HEALTH IN UNIVERSITY
10
Mental Health Handbook For University Students 
conflicts with roommates or peers. Social media can also contribute to social 
challenges, as you may feel pressure to present a perfect image online, 
leading to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem.
Relationship problems
Relationships within the university setup can significantly impact your mental 
well-being (Ritter et al., 2023). Breakups, in particular, are potent stressors 
that often cast a shadow on academic and personal spheres. The emotional 
turbulence of a breakup can trigger feelings of loneliness, sadness, and even 
a sense of identity loss. Coping with the aftermath may pose challenges as 
you struggle with reshaping your daily life, redefining plans, and rebuilding 
self-esteem.
Financial stress
Financial stress is another common factor that can impact your mental health 
(Guan et al., 2022). You may struggle to pay for tuition, living expenses, 
and other costs associated with attending university, leading to feelings of 
financial burden and stress. This stress can be worsened by the high levels of 
debt that you may accumulate to finance your education.
Transitioning to university life
Transitioning to university life can also be a significant challenge for students, 
particularly for those who are the first in their family to attend university 
or who are from diverse backgrounds (Cheng et al., 2023). Students may 
experience cultural shock (such as language barriers, social norms, and 
educational system differences when adjusting to a new environment), 
homesickness, and feelings of disorientation as they adjust to a new and 
unfamiliar environment.

Some common mental health disorders faced by university students
As alluded to earlier, mental health issues are common and can affect anyone 
regardless of their background, age, or gender. These issues can range from 
mild to severe and can have a significant impact on an individual’s daily life, 
relationships, and overall well-being. To better understand common mental 
health disorders, we will be using some hypothetical examples/vignettes 
throughout our conversation. These examples are fictional and do not reflect 
any real individuals or situations. They are used solely to help illustrate the 
symptoms and experiences of different mental health conditions. Let’s get 
going. 
Anxiety
Definition: “Anxiety is a persistent state of excessive worry, fear, or unease, 
often related to future uncertainties”. Anxiety is a normal human emotion 
that everyone experiences at some point in their lives. However, when 
anxiety becomes excessive, persistent, and interferes with daily functioning, 
it can be a sign of an anxiety disorder (American Psychological Association 
[APA], 2019). Anxiety can manifest in a variety of ways, such as excessive 
IV.	   COMMON MENTAL HEALTH  
	
  ISSUES
12
Mental Health Handbook For University Students 
and persistent worry about everyday things, such as assignments, exams, 
finances, or relationships.
Common symptoms: Restlessness, increased heart rate, racing thoughts, 
irritability, muscle tension, and difficulty concentrating.
Example: Emily, a second-year student, often wrestles with anxiety. As 
exams draw near, her mind becomes a battlefield of uncertainties such as 
“What if I fail?”, “What if the questions are too difficult?”, and “What if 
I can’t recall the answers?” Consequently, sleep escapes her, replaced by 
nights filled with restlessness and racing thoughts about the upcoming exams.
Stress
Definition: Stress is a natural response to challenging situations, but chronic 
stress can have adverse effects on mental health. It arises when the demands 
placed on an individual exceed their coping abilities. According to the WHO 
(2023), everyone experiences stress to some degree, but the way we respond 
to stress, however, makes a big difference to our overall well-being.
Types of stress: There are different types of stress, including acute stress, 
episodic acute stress, and chronic stress. Acute stress is the most common 
form of stress and is often short-term. It arises from the demands and 
pressures of the recent past and anticipated demands and pressures of the near 
future. Episodic acute stress occurs when a person frequently experiences 
acute stress, leading to a pattern of worry and anxiety. Chronic stress, on 
the other hand, is long-term and can result from situations such as poverty, 
dysfunctional families (families with emotional/physical abuse, conflicts, 
lack of respect and love etc.), or being trapped in an unhappy marriage or job.
Common symptoms: Fatigue or tiredness, irritability or feeling restless, 
headaches, muscle tension, and changes in sleep patterns.
Example: Mark, an ambitious student and a captain of the university football 
team, faces mounting stress as deadlines loom. Juggling assignments and 
social commitments leaves him feeling perpetually on edge. The weight of 
expectations, both self-imposed and external, manifests physically, impacting 
Mark’s ability to find joy in his academic pursuits.
13
Mental Health Handbook For University Students 
Depression
Definition: Depression is a mood disorder characterised by persistent 
feelings of sadness, loss of interest or pleasure in activities, and a general 
sense of hopelessness (National Institute of Mental Health – NIMH, 2021).
Common symptoms: Persistent sadness, fatigue/ tiredness, changes in 
appetite or weight, feelings of worthlessness, and difficulty concentrating.
Example: Sarah, who was once full of life, now battles a constant darkness. 
The joy she found in hanging out and learning has faded. Everyday tasks feel 
like big hurdles, and depression keeps her away from friends and studies, 
leaving her feeling empty. For instance, she used to love socialising, but 
now even the idea of gatherings makes her uneasy, adding to her sense of 
loneliness.
Addiction
Definition: Addiction involves the compulsive use of substances 
(experiencing an uncontrollable urge to consume alcohol, smoke cigarettes/
chamba, use drugs, or do certain actions to satisfy yourself) or engaging 
in behaviours despite harmful consequences. It often serves as a coping 
mechanism for underlying issues.
Common Symptoms: Loss of control over use, continued use despite negative 
consequences, preoccupation with substances or behaviour, and withdrawal 
symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms happens when, for example, you decide 
to stop consuming alcohol but your body responds negatively and you feel 
sick because your body is used to receiving alcohol. Symptoms may include 
shaking and feeling like vomiting.
Example: James, under the strain of academic pressure, turns to beer-
drinking and smoking marijuana for relief. What started as an occasional 
escape transforms into a concerning pattern. He can’t control how he drinks 
or smokes weed, despite causing problems, like missing classes and having 
conflicts with friends. Skipping a drink or a joint (cannabis) makes him feel 
uneasy or sick.
14
Mental Health Handbook For University Students 
Sleep disorder
Definition: Sleep disorders interfere with the regular sleep pattern, leading 
to difficulties falling or staying asleep (Holder & Narula, 2022). They can 
result from various factors, including stress.
Common Symptoms: Insomnia (sleeplessness), difficulty staying asleep, 
excessive daytime sleepiness, and fatigue/ tiredness.
Example: Olivia can’t sleep well at night, and it’s making her tired all the 
time. Because she’s so tired, studying is hard. This makes her feel stressed, 
and it’s not good for her mental health or doing well in her studies.

Suicide warning Signs
Suicide is the act of intentionally causing 
one’s death, and it is a major health problem. 
Suicide doesn’t have a singular cause; it 
typically arises when various stressors and 
health issues intersect, leading to feelings 
of hopelessness and despair. Most suicides 
are related to psychiatric disease (Brådvik, 
2018). Depression, frequently undiagnosed 
A drop in academic grades may indicate a 
mental disorder
or untreated, is the primary condition linked to suicide. Untreated conditions 
such as depression, anxiety, and substance-related issues heighten the risk of 
suicide. 
Before we go any further, I just want you know that choosing suicide is never 
a viable solution or option; there are always people willing to listen and 
support you through difficult times. It’s crucial to be watchful for changes 
in behaviour or the emergence of entirely new behaviours when suspecting 
someone might be suicidal. The highest level of concern arises when the 
altered or new behaviour is connected to a distressing event, loss, or change. 
Individuals contemplating suicide typically display one or more warning 
signs, expressed through their words or actions. Recognizing the warning 
signs of suicide is crucial for early intervention, be it seeking-help (like 
talking to someone), or offering help to a colleague/friend. These signs 
include: 
Talk
If a person talks about:
•	
Killing themselves – Note that individuals may not necessarily say “I 
am going to kill myself” although at time they may, but you have to be 
on the lookout for statements such as: “I just don’t see a way out of this” 
or “Sometimes, I think it would be easier if I weren’t here anymore.”
•	
Feeling hopeless – Someone who is hopeless, will utter statements such 
as “I’ve tried everything, and nothing seems to get better. I can’t see any 
hope for the future.”
•	
Having no reason to live – Similar to someone who is hopeless, people 
who feel they have no reason to live will often express that they see no 
point in living anymore. E.g. “Every day feels like a struggle, and I can’t 
find a reason to keep going. What’s the point?”
•	
Being a burden to others – Watch out for statements/ feelings such as 
“I feel like everyone would be better off without me. I’m just a burden to 
everyone around me.”
•	
Feeling trapped – If you feel or hear someone say “I feel stuck in this 
situation, and I don’t see a way out. It’s like there’s no escape”, this is 
another warning sign. 
19
Mental Health Handbook For University Students 
•	
Unbearable pain – People who have gone through a lot feel like “The 
pain inside is just too much. It’s overwhelming, and I don’t know how 
much longer I can endure it.”
Behaviour
Behaviours that may signal suicidal risk, especially if related to a painful 
event, loss or change:
•	
Increased use of alcohol (beer, spirits etc.) or drugs (narcotics such as 
chamba)
•	
Looking for a way to end their lives, such as searching online for methods
•	
Withdrawing from activities
•	
Isolating from family and friends
•	
Sleeping too much or too little
•	
Visiting or calling people to say goodbye
•	
Giving away prized possessions
•	
Aggression
20
Mental Health Handbook For University Students 
Mood
People who are considering suicide 
often display one or more of the 
following moods:
•	
Depression (persistent feelings 
of sadness, hopelessness, and a 
lack of interest or pleasure in 
daily activities).
•	
Anxiety (a state of uneasiness, 
fear, 
or 
worry 
often 
accompanied 
by 
physical 
symptoms 
like 
increased 
heart rate, muscle tension, and 
restlessness).
Watch out for signs of short of temper
•	
Loss of interest (the diminished 
ability to find pleasure or 
interest in activities that were 
once enjoyable).
•	
Irritability (easily becoming 
annoyed or agitated. It may 
manifest 
as 
impatience, 
frustration, or a short temper 
in response to stimuli that 
wouldn’t typically provoke 
such reactions)
•	
Humiliation 
and 
shame 
(feelings of embarrassment, 
guilt, or disgrace due to 
perceived failures or judgments 
from oneself or others).

Seek 
counselling 
services 
and 
encourage others to do the same.
Note: Suicidal ideation refers to thoughts and contemplation about ending 
one’s own life.
Mental health coping strategies are essential for managing and improving 
mental well-being. These strategies can help individuals deal with stress, 
anxiety, depression, and other mental health challenges. It’s important to note 
that coping strategies can vary from person to person, and what works for 
one individual may not work for another. Now let us look at some effective 
mental health coping strategies:
Seeking counselling services
MUBAS offers counselling services to students. This can be through the 
University Chaplain, Director of Students Affairs and the MUBAS Clinic. 
You need to take advantage of these services. The above-mentioned are 
trained to provide support and guidance for a variety of mental health issues, 
including stress, anxiety, depression, and more (while respecting your 
privacy). They can offer coping strategies tailored to your individual needs 
and help you navigate your academic and personal challenges.
Example: If you are feeling overwhelmed with academic pressure, scheduling 
a session with the University Chaplain, Dean of Students, or your lecturer can 
provide a safe space to discuss your concerns and explore coping strategies.
Build a support system/invest in your human relationships
Strive to build a strong support system within the university community, as 
this can be beneficial for your mental well-being. This can include forming 
study groups (group discussions/ma disi), joining clubs or organisations on 
campus, or simply connecting with peers who share similar interests. Having 
a support system can provide a sense of belonging and reduce feelings of 
isolation.
Example: Joining a study group for a challenging course can create a 
supportive environment where you can share knowledge, discuss difficulties, 
and foster a sense of camaraderie.
22
Mental Health Handbook For University Students 
VI.	   COPING STRATEGIES
Time management and prioritisation
I am sure you have learnt/you will be learning English for Academic 
Purposes – EAP in year one. University life can be overwhelming, and poor 
time management can contribute to increased stress and anxiety. Create a 
realistic schedule to balance academic and personal activities. Identify the 
most important tasks that need attention. Avoid procrastination (the act 
of delaying tasks). An example is when you wait until the night before 
an exam to start studying. Procrastination, or delaying tasks until the last 
minute, can significantly contribute to heightened stress levels. Prioritising 
involves not just recognising deadlines but also evaluating the importance 
and impact of each task. By identifying the most crucial assignments, exams, 
or personal commitments, you will be able to allocate your time and energy 
more efficiently. This approach ensures that urgent and high-priority tasks 
are addressed promptly, reducing the likelihood of feeling overwhelmed. 
Prioritise assignments, exams, or personal commitments based on deadlines 
and importance.
23
Mental Health Handbook For University Students 
Example: If you have multiple assignments due in a week, creating a detailed 
schedule that allocates specific time slots for each task ensures you tackle 
high-priority items first, reducing last-minute stress.
Support systems are crucial for maintaining a healthy mind
Regular exercise and physical activity
It is important to look after your health, diet as well as exercising. Engaging 
in regular physical activity has been shown to have numerous mental health 
benefits, including reducing stress and anxiety. MUBAS has fitness centres, 
sports teams (netball, football, volleyball etc.), and recreational activities 
that you can participate in. 
Example: You don’t have to be a professional or participate at a competitive 
level. Partaking in MUBAS sports teams, like the volleyball, football, 
basketball, athletics or netball teams, not only promotes physical health but 
also offers a social aspect, creating a positive and holistic impact on your 
mental well-being.
Healthy sleep habits
Adequate sleep is crucial for mental well-being. Prioritising good sleep 
such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule and creating a restful sleep 
environment, can significantly impact your mental health.
Example: Establishing a routine of going to bed (e.g. 8 p.m.) and waking 
up at consistent times (e.g. 6 a.m.) daily, coupled with creating a relaxing 
24
Mental Health Handbook For University Students 
Exercise is powerful tool for nurturing mental well-being
bedtime ritual (such as winding down by switching off your phone and 
listening to soft music etc.), can improve your sleep quality and overall 
mental resilience.
Setting realistic expectations
Many students face mental health challenges due to unrealistic academic or 
personal expectations. Setting achievable goals and being kind to yourself 
when facing setbacks is essential for maintaining good mental health.
Example: It’s okay to learn from mistakes and failures. Remember, not 
everyone is “a distinction” student, and there’s no need to compete with 
anyone. Instead, compete with yourself, aiming to improve every time and 
achieve a good enough grade without the pressure of being number one. 
Engage in creative outlets
Engage in creative activities such as art, music, or writing. This can serve as 
a form of self-expression and stress relief.
Example: There are several music clubs and choirs on campus which you 
can join and showcase your skills and talent. 
Online resources
Explore apps or websites offering stress management tools. Online therapy 
platforms can also provide support.
Example: Utilise platforms like Better Help to engage in virtual therapy 
sessions, allowing you to explore coping strategies, gain insights into 
stress triggers, and receive professional support from the comfort of your 
environment.
In summary, using coping strategies, building resilience, and seeking support 
can help you navigate life’s challenges. By incorporating these tools into 
your daily life, you can boost your mental well-being and face whatever 
comes your way.

Recap of key points
In this exploration of mental health for university students, we’ve delved 
into the crucial role it plays in the well-being of individuals navigating the 
challenges of academic life. Understanding mental health is foundational, 
encompassing definitions, the significance it holds, and distinguishing between 
mental disorders and illnesses, while addressing common misconceptions 
and stigmas. We have identified various factors affecting mental health in 
the university setting, from the pressures of academics to social challenges, 
relationship complexities, financial stress, and the transformative phase of 
transitioning to university life.
Examining common mental health issues such as anxiety, stress, depression, 
addiction, and sleeping disorders, we’ve highlighted the importance of 
recognising signs and symptoms. Behavioural, emotional, and physical 
changes, along with academic performance indicators, serve as crucial cues. 
The coping strategies section provides a comprehensive toolkit for students, 
from seeking counselling services, building a robust support system, and 
effective time management to incorporating regular exercise, maintaining 
healthy sleep habits, and engaging in creative outlets. Online resources are 
also highlighted for convenient accessibility.
University resources and support services, including counselling services 
and mental health awareness programs, play a pivotal role. We emphasised 
the importance of confidentiality in seeking assistance and participating in 
mental health awareness initiatives. The case studies and personal stories 
section illuminates the real-life experiences of individuals who triumphed 
over mental health challenges, offering inspiration and hope. These stories 
showcase the effectiveness of the coping strategies discussed earlier.
As we conclude, the significance of mental health in university settings 
cannot be overstated. Recognizing its impact, seeking help, and fostering a 
supportive environment are essential steps toward promoting the well-being 
of university students.
IX.	   CONCLUSION
32
Mental Health Handbook For University Students 
Encouragement to seek help
The narratives underscore the vital importance of seeking help when facing 
mental health difficulties. Recognizing that reaching out is a testament to 
strength, not weakness, forms the cornerstone of the journey toward healing. 
Talking or opening up to someone doesn’t mean you are weak. It is actually 
the opposite. It means you are strong and you have embarked on a journey 
to overcome your problem. Whether through university counselling services, 
support groups, or confiding in friends and family, the path to recovery begins 
with acknowledging the importance of support.
Future outlook for mental health in university settings
Looking forward, the trajectory of mental health in university settings 
hinges on sustained efforts to foster understanding, destigmatise mental 
health challenges, and fortify support systems. Initiatives like mental health 
awareness weeks, counselling services, and community engagement lay the 
groundwork for a compassionate environment. Dispelling misconceptions, 
raising awareness, and strengthening support networks can transform 
universities into strongholds of holistic well-being, ensuring every student’s 
journey is marked not only by academic achievement but also by profound 
personal growth.
