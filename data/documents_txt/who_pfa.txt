Psychological first aid: Guide for field workers
foreword
When terrible things happen in our communities, countries and the world, we want to 
reach out a helping hand to those who are affected. This guide covers psychological 
first aid which involves humane, supportive and practical help to fellow human beings 
suffering serious crisis events. It is written for people in a position to help others who have 
experienced an extremely distressing event. It gives a framework for supporting people in 
ways that respect their dignity, culture and abilities. Despite its name, psychological first 
aid covers both social and psychological support.
Perhaps you are called upon as a staff member or volunteer to help in a major disaster, or you 
find yourself at the scene of an accident where people are hurt. Perhaps you are a teacher or 
health worker talking with someone from your community who has just witnessed the violent 
death of a loved one. This guide will help you to know the most supportive things to say and 
do for people who are very distressed. It will also give you information on how to approach a 
new situation safely for yourself and others, and not to cause harm by your actions. 
Psychological first aid has been recommended by many international and national 
expert groups, including the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) and the Sphere 
Project. Psychological first aid is an alternative to psychological debriefing. In 2009, the 
World Health Organization’s (WHO) mhGAP Guidelines Development Group evaluated 
the evidence for psychological first aid and psychological debriefing. They concluded 
that psychological first aid, rather than psychological debriefing, should be offered to 
people in severe distress after being recently exposed to a traumatic event. 
This guide was developed in order to have widely agreed upon psychological first aid 
materials for use in low and middle income countries. The information we have given 
here is a model only. You will need to adapt it appropriately to the local context and the 
culture of the people you will help. 
This guide – endorsed by many international agencies – reflects the emerging science 
and international consensus on how to support people in the immediate aftermath of 
extremely stressful events.

Understanding PFA
1             Psychological first aid: Guide for field workers
In this chapter we discuss:
1.1	 How do crisis events affect people?
1.2	 What is PFA?
1.3	 PFA: who, when and where?
1.1  How do crisis events affect people?
Different kinds of distressing events happen in the world, such as war, natural disasters, 
accidents, fires and interpersonal violence (for example, sexual violence). Individuals, 
families or entire communities may be affected. People may lose their homes or loved ones, 
be separated from family and community, or may witness violence, destruction or death.
Although everyone is affected in some way by these events, there are a wide range of 
reactions and feelings each person can have. Many people may feel overwhelmed, 
confused or very uncertain about what is happening. They can feel very fearful or anxious, 
or numb and detached. Some people may have mild reactions, whereas others may have 
more severe reactions. How someone reacts depends on many factors, including:
»»
the nature and severity of the event(s) they experience; 
»»
their experience with previous distressing events; 
»»
the support they have in their life from others; 
»»
their physical health;
»»
their personal and family history of mental health problems; 
»»
their cultural background and traditions; 
»»
their age (for example, children of different age groups react differently).
Psychological first aid: Guide for field workers             2
Chapter 1
1	 WHO (2010) and Sphere (2011) describe psychological debriefing as promoting ventilation by asking a person to 
briefly but systematically recount their perceptions, thoughts and emotional reactions during a recent stressful event. 
This intervention is not recommended. This is distinct from routine operational debriefing of aid workers used by some 
organizations at the end of a mission or work task. 
Every person has strengths and abilities to help them cope with life challenges. However, 
some people are particularly vulnerable in a crisis situation and may need extra help. 
This includes people who may be at risk or need additional support because of their age 
(children, elderly), because they have a mental or physical disability, or because they 
belong to groups who may be marginalized or targeted for violence. Section 3.5 provides 
guidance for helping vulnerable people.
1.2  What is PFA?
According to Sphere (2011) and IASC (2007), psychological first aid (PFA) describes a 
humane, supportive response to a fellow human being who is suffering and who may 
need support. PFA involves the following themes:
»»
providing practical care and support, which does not intrude;
»»
assessing needs and concerns;
»»
helping people to address basic needs (for example, food and water, information);
»»
listening to people, but not pressuring them to talk;
»»
comforting people and helping them to feel calm;
»»
helping people connect to information, services and social supports;
»»
protecting people from further harm.
It is also important to understand what PFA is not:
»»
It is not something that only professionals can do.
»»
It is not professional counselling.
»»
It is not “psychological debriefing”1 in that PFA does not necessarily involve a 
detailed discussion of the event that caused the distress.
»»
It is not asking someone to analyse what happened to them or to put time and 
events in order.
»»
Although PFA involves being available to listen to people’s stories, it is not about 
pressuring people to tell you their feelings and reactions to an event.
3             Psychological first aid: Guide for field workers
PFA is an alternative to “psychological debriefing” which has been found to be 
ineffective. In contrast, PFA involves factors that seem to be most helpful to people’s 
long-term recovery (according to various studies and the consensus of many crisis 
helpers2). These include:
»»
feeling safe, connected to others, calm and hopeful;
»»
having access to social, physical and emotional support; and
»»
feeling able to help themselves, as individuals and communities.
1.3  PFA: Who, when and where?
Who is PFA for?  
PFA is for distressed people who have been recently exposed to a serious crisis 
event. You can provide help to both children and adults. However, not everyone who 
experiences a crisis event will need or want PFA. Do not force help on people who do 
not want it, but make yourself easily available to those who may want support.

Psychological first aid: Guide for field workers             4
Chapter 1
There may be situations when someone needs much more advanced support than 
PFA alone. Know your limits and get help from others, such as medical personnel 
(if available), your colleagues or other people in the area, local authorities, or 
community and religious leaders. In the following box we have listed people who 
need more immediate advanced support. People in these situations need medical or 
other help as a priority to save life. 
People who need more immediate advanced support:
»»
people with serious, life-threatening injuries who need emergency medical care
»»
people who are so upset that they cannot care for themselves or their children
»»
people who may hurt themselves
»»
people who may hurt others
When is PFA provided?
Although people may need access to help and support for a long time after an event, PFA 
is aimed at helping people who have been very recently affected by a crisis event. You 
can provide PFA when you first have contact with very distressed people. This is usually 
during or immediately after an event. However, it may sometimes be days or weeks after, 
depending on how long the event lasted and how severe it was.   
5             Psychological first aid: Guide for field workers
Where is PFA provided?
You can offer PFA wherever it is safe enough for you to do so. This is often 
in community settings, such as at the scene of an accident, or places where 
distressed people are served, such as health centres, shelters or camps, 
schools and distribution sites for food or other types of help. Ideally, try to 
provide PFA where you can have some privacy to talk with the person when 
appropriate. For people who have been exposed to certain types of crisis 
events, such as sexual violence, privacy is essential for confidentiality and to 
respect the person’s dignity.

chapter 2 
How to help responsibly
7             Psychological first aid: Guide for field workers
Helping responsibly involves four main points:
2.1	 Respect safety, dignity and rights.
2.2	 Adapt what you do to take account of the person’s culture.
2.3	 Be aware of other emergency response measures.
2.4	 Look after yourself.
2.1  Respect safety, dignity and rights
When you take on the responsibility to help in situations where people have been affected 
by a distressing event, it is important to act in ways that respect the safety, dignity and rights 
of the people you are helping3. The following principles apply to any person or agency 
involved in humanitarian response, including those who provide PFA:
Respect people’s…
Safety
»»
Avoid putting people at further risk of harm as a result of  
your actions.
»»
Make sure, to the best of your ability, that the adults and children you 
help are safe and protect them from physical or psychological harm.
Dignity
»»
Treat people with respect and according to their cultural and 
social norms.
Rights
»»
Make sure people can access help fairly and without discrimination.
»»
Help people to claim their rights and access available support.
»»
Act only in the best interest of any person you encounter.
Keep these principles in mind in all of your actions and with all people you encounter, 
whatever their age, gender or ethnic background. Consider what these principles mean 
in terms of your cultural context. Know and follow your agency codes of conduct at all 
times if you work or volunteer for an agency that has these codes. 
We offer the following Ethical Do’s and Don’ts as guidance to avoid causing further harm 
to the person, to provide the best care possible, and to act only in their best interest.

Chapter 2
»»
Be honest and trustworthy.
»»
Respect people’s right to make 
their own decisions.
»»
Be aware of and set aside your 
own biases and prejudices.
»»
Make it clear to people that 
even if they refuse help now, 
they can still access help in  
the future.
»»
Respect privacy and keep the 
person’s story confidential, if 
this is appropriate.
»»
Behave appropriately by 
considering the person’s 
culture, age and gender.
»»
Don’t exploit your relationship  
as a helper.
»»
Don’t ask the person for any 
money or favour for helping them.
»»
Don’t make false promises or 
give false information.
»»
Don’t exaggerate your skills.
»»
Don’t force help on people, and 
don’t be intrusive or pushy.
»»
Don’t pressure people to tell you 
their story.
»»
Don’t share the person’s story 
with others.
»»
Don’t judge the person for their 
actions or feelings.
2.2  Adapt what you do to take account 
of the person’s culture
Whenever there is a crisis event, there are often people of various cultural backgrounds 
among the affected population, including minorities or others who may be marginalized. 
Culture determines how we relate to people, and what is all right and not all right to say 
and do. For example, in some cultures it is not customary for a person to share feelings 
with someone outside their family. Or it may only be appropriate for women to speak with 
other women, or perhaps certain ways of dressing or covering oneself are very important. 
You may find yourself working with people of backgrounds different from your own. 
As a helper, it is important to be aware of your own cultural background and beliefs 
so you can set aside your own biases. Offer help in ways that are most appropriate and 
comfortable to the people you are supporting. 
Each crisis situation is unique. Adapt this guide to the context, considering local social 
and cultural norms. See the following box for questions you can consider in providing 
PFA in different cultures. 
9             Psychological first aid: Guide for field workers
 
Consider the following questions as you prepare 
to offer PFA in different cultures:
Dress
»»
Do I need to dress a certain way to be respectful? 
»»
Will impacted people be in need of certain clothing items to 
keep their dignity and customs? 
Language
»»
What is the customary way of greeting people in this culture?
»»
What language do they speak? 
Gender,  
Age and 
Power
»»
Should affected women only be approached by women helpers? 
»»
Who may I approach? (In other words, the head of the family 
or community?)
Touching 
and 
Behaviour
»»
What are the usual customs around touching people? 
»»
Is it all right to hold someone’s hand or touch their shoulder? 
»»
Are there special things to consider in terms of behaviour around 
the elderly, children, women or others?
Beliefs and 
Religion
»»
Who are the different ethnic and religious groups among the 
affected people?
»»
What beliefs or practices are important to the people affected? 
»»
How might they understand or explain what has happened?
Psychological first aid: Guide for field workers             10
Chapter 2
2.3  Be aware of other emergency 
response measures
PFA is part of a broader response to large humanitarian emergencies (IASC, 2007). 
When hundreds or thousands of people are affected, different types of emergency 
response measures take place, such as search-and-rescue operations, emergency 
health care, shelter, food distribution, and family tracing and child protection activities. 
Often it is challenging for aid workers and volunteers to know exactly what services are 
available where. This is true during mass disasters and in places which do not already 
have a functioning infrastructure for health and other services. 
Try to be aware of what services and supports may be available so you can share 
information with people you are helping and tell them how to access practical help. 
11             Psychological first aid: Guide for field workers
Whenever possible in responding to a  
crisis situation:
»»
follow the direction of relevant authorities managing the crisis;
»»
learn what emergency responses are being organized and what  
resources are available to help people, if any;
»»
don’t get in the way of search-and-rescue or emergency medical  
personnel; and
»»
know your role and the limits of your role.
 
It is not necessary to have a “psychosocial” background in order to offer PFA. However, if 
you want to help in crisis settings, we recommend that you work through an organization 
or community group. If you act on your own, you may put yourself at risk, it may have a 
negative effect on coordination efforts, and you are unlikely to be able to link affected 
people with the resources and support they need. 
2.4  Look after yourself
Helping responsibly also means taking 
care of your own health and wellbeing. As 
a helper, you may be affected by what you 
experience in a crisis situation, or you or 
your family may be directly affected by the 
event. It is important to pay extra attention 
to your own wellbeing and be sure that you 
are physically and emotionally able to help 
others. Take care of yourself so that you can 
best care for others. If working in a team, 
be aware of the wellbeing of your fellow 
helpers as well. (See Chapter 4 for more on 
caring for caregivers.)

Chapter 3 
Providing PFA
13             Psychological first aid: Guide for field workers
In this chapter, we will discuss: 
3.1	 Good communication with people in distress.
3.2	 Preparing to help.
3.3	 The PFA action principles of look, listen and link. 
3.4	 Ending your help. 
3.5	 People who are likely to need special attention in a crisis situation. 
3.1  Good communication
The way you communicate with someone in distress is very important. People who have 
been through a crisis event may be very upset, anxious or confused. Some people may 
blame themselves for things that happened during the crisis. Being calm and showing 
understanding can help people in distress feel more safe and secure, understood, 
respected and cared for appropriately. 
Someone who has been through a distressing event may want to tell you their story. Listening 
to someone’s story can be a great support. However, it is important not to pressure anyone 
to tell you what they have been through. Some people may not want to speak about what has 
happened or their circumstances. However, they may value it if you stay with them quietly, let 
them know you are there if they want to talk, or offer practical support like a meal or a glass 
of water. Don’t talk too much; allow for silence. Keeping silent for a while may give the person 
space and encourage them to share with you if they wish.  
To communicate well, be aware of both your words and body language, such as facial 
expressions, eye contact, gestures, and the way you sit or stand in relation to the other 
person. Each culture has its own particular ways of behaving that are appropriate and 
respectful. Speak and behave in ways that take into account the person’s culture, age, 
gender, customs and religion. 
Psychological first aid: Guide for field workers             14
Chapter 3
Below are suggestions for things to say and do, and what not to say and do. Most 
importantly, be yourself, be genuine and be sincere in offering your help and care. 
  
»»
Try to find a quiet place to talk, and 
minimize outside distractions.
»»
Respect privacy and keep the 
person’s story confidential, if this 
is appropriate. 
»»
Stay near the person but keep an 
appropriate distance depending on 
their age, gender and culture.
»»
Let them know you are listening; 
for example, nod your head or say 
“hmmmm….”
»»
Be patient and calm.  
»»
Provide factual information, if 
you have it. Be honest about what 
you know and don’t know. “I don’t 
know, but I will try to find out 
about that for you.”
»»
Give information in a way the 
person can understand – keep  
it simple. 
»»
Acknowledge how they are feeling 
and any losses or important events 
they tell you about, such as loss of 
their home or death of a loved one. 
“I’m so sorry. I can imagine this is 
very sad for you.”
»»
Acknowledge the person’s 
strengths and how they have 
helped themselves.
»»
Allow for silence.
»»
Don’t pressure someone to tell 
their story. 
»»
Don’t interrupt or rush someone’s 
story (for example, don’t look at 
your watch or speak too rapidly). 
»»
Don’t touch the person if you’re not 
sure it is appropriate to do so. 
»»
Don’t judge what they have or 
haven’t done, or how they are 
feeling. Don’t say: “You shouldn’t 
feel that way,” or “You should feel 
lucky you survived.”
»»
Don’t make up things you  
don’t know.
»»
Don’t use terms that are too 
technical.
»»
Don’t tell them someone else’s story.
»»
Don’t talk about your own troubles.
»»
Don’t give false promises or  
false reassurances. 
»»
Don’t think and act as if you 
must solve all the person’s 
problems for them.
»»
Don’t take away the person’s 
strength and sense of being able 
to care for themselves.
»»
Don’t talk about people in negative 
terms (for example, don’t call them 
“crazy” or “mad”).
Keep good communication in mind as you look, listen and link – the action principles 
of PFA covered in the following pages.

Crisis situations can be chaotic and often need urgent action. However, wherever possible 
before entering a crisis site, try to get accurate information about the situation. Consider 
the following questions:
Psychological first aid: Guide for field workers             16
Chapter 3
Before entering a crisis site, learn about  
the following:
Important questions
The crisis

What happened? 
»»
When and where did it take place?

Who is providing for basic needs like emergency medical 
care, food, water, shelter or tracing family members? 
»»
Where and how can people access those services?
»»
Who else is helping? Are community members involved  
in responding?
Safety and 
security 
concerns
»»
Is the crisis event over or continuing, such as an aftershock 
from an earthquake or continuing conflict? 
»»
What dangers may be in the environment, such as rebels, 
landmines or damaged infrastructure? 
»»
Are there areas to avoid entering because they are not secure 
(for example, obvious physical dangers) or because you are 
not allowed to be there?
These important preparation questions can help you to understand the situation you are 
entering, to offer PFA more effectively and to be  
more aware of your safety.   
17             Psychological first aid: Guide for field workers
3.3  Action principles of PFA – look, 
listen and link 
The three basic action principles of PFA are look, listen and link. These action principles will help 
guide how you view and safely enter a crisis situation, approach affected people and understand 
their needs, and link them with practical support and information (see the table below). 
Look

If you are not certain 
about the safety of

for people in need. If 
possible, communicate 
with people in distress 
from a safe distance.

a few moments – to “look” around you before offering help. If you suddenly find yourself in 
a crisis situation without time to prepare, this may be just a quick scan. These moments will 
give you a chance to be calm, be safe and think before you act. See the following table 
for questions to consider and important messages as you “look” around you. 
19             Psychological first aid: Guide for field workers
People may react in various ways to a crisis. Some  
examples of distress responses to crisis are listed below:  
»»
physical symptoms (for example, shaking, 
headaches, feeling very tired, loss of 
appetite, aches and pains)
»»
crying, sadness, depressed mood, grief
»»
anxiety, fear
»»
being “on guard” or “jumpy”
»»
worry that something really bad is going  
to happen
»»
insomnia, nightmares
»»
irritability, anger
»»
guilt, shame (for example, for having 
survived, or for not helping or saving others)
»»
confused, emotionally numb, or feeling 
unreal or in a daze
»»
appearing withdrawn or very still  
(not moving)
»»
not responding to others, not speaking at all
»»
disorientation (for example, not knowing 
their own name, where they are from, or 
what happened)
»»
not being able to care for themselves or 
their children (for example, not eating or 
drinking, not able to make simple decisions)
Some people may only be mildly distressed or not  
distressed at all.
Most people will recover well over time, especially if they can restore their basic needs 
and receive support such as help from those around them and/or PFA. However, people 
with either severe or long-lasting distress reactions may need more support than PFA 
alone, particularly if they cannot function in their daily life or if they are a danger to 
themselves or others. Make sure that severely distressed people are not left alone and 
try to keep them safe until the reaction passes or until you can find help from health 
personnel, local leaders or other community members in the area. 
Also, look for people among the affected population who are likely to need special 
attention for their care and safety:
Psychological first aid: Guide for field workers             20
Chapter 3
People who are likely to need special attention in a 
crisis (see Section 3.5):
»»
Children – including adolescents – especially those separated from their 
caregivers, may need protection from abuse and exploitation. They will also 
likely need care from those around them and help to meet their basic needs.
»»
People with health conditions or physical and mental disabilities may need 
special help to get to a safe place, to be protected from abuse and to access 
medical care and other services. This may include frail elderly people, 
pregnant women, people with severe mental disorders, or people with visual 
or hearing difficulties.
»»
People at risk of discrimination or violence, such as women or people  
of certain ethnic groups, may need special  
protection to be safe in the crisis setting and  
support to access available help.
 
Listen

Listen to people, and help them to feel calm.
Listening properly to people you are helping is essential to understand their situation and needs, 
to help them to feel calm, and to be able to offer appropriate help. Learn to listen with your:
»»
	Eyes	
››    giving the person your undivided attention
»»
	Ears	
››    truly hearing their concerns 
»»
	Heart	 ››    with caring and showing respect
21             Psychological first aid: Guide for field workers
1. Approach people who may need support:
»»
Approach people respectfully and according to their culture. 
»»
Introduce yourself by name and organization.
»»
Ask if you can provide help. 
»»
If possible, find a safe and quiet place to talk.
»»
Help the person feel comfortable; for  
example, offer water if you can.
»»
Try to keep the person safe.
»»
Remove the person from immediate 
danger, if it is safe to do so.
»»
Try to protect the person from 
exposure to the media for their 
privacy and dignity. 
»»
If the person is very distressed, try 
to make sure they are not alone.  
2. Ask about people’s needs and concerns:
»»
Although some needs may be 
obvious, such as a blanket or 
covering for someone whose 
clothing is torn, always ask what 
people need and what their 
concerns are. 
»»
Find out what is most important to 
them at this moment, and help them 
work out what their priorities are. 
3. Listen to people and help them to feel calm:
»»
Stay close to the person.
»»
Do not pressure the person to talk.
»»
Listen in case they want to talk 
about what happened. 
»»
If they are very distressed, help 
them to feel calm and try to make 
sure they are not alone.

Help people to feel calm
Some people who experience a crisis situation may be very anxious or upset. 
They may feel confused or overwhelmed, and may have some physical reactions 
such as shaking or trembling, difficulty breathing or feeling their heart pounding. 
The following are some techniques to help very distressed people to feel calm in 
their mind and body: 
»»
Keep your tone of voice calm and soft.
»»
If culturally appropriate, try to maintain some eye contact with the person as 
you talk with them.
»»
Remind the person that you are there to help them. Remind them that they 
are safe, if it is true.
»»
If someone feels unreal or disconnected from their surroundings, it may help 
them to make contact with their current environment and themselves. You 
can do this by asking them to: 
»»
Place and feel their feet on the floor.
»»
Tap their fingers or hands on their lap.
»»
Notice some non-distressing things in their environment,  
such as things they can see, hear or feel. Have them tell you  
what they see and hear. 
»»
Encourage the person to focus on their breathing, and to  
breathe slowly.

People may feel vulnerable, isolated or powerless after a distressing event. In some situations, 
their daily life is disrupted. They may be unable to access their usual supports, or they may 
find themselves suddenly living in stressful conditions. Linking people with practical support 
is a major part of PFA. Remember that PFA is often a one-time intervention and you may only 
be there to help for a short time. Affected people will need to use their own coping skills to 
recover in the long term.  
Help people to help  
themselves and to regain  
control of their situation. 
 
Psychological first aid: Guide for field workers             24
Chapter 3
1. Help people address basic needs and access services
In helping people to address basic needs, consider the following:
»»
Immediately after a crisis event, try to help the person in distress to meet the basic 
needs they request, such as food, water, shelter and sanitation.
»»
Learn what specific needs people have – such as health care, clothing or items for 
feeding small children (cups and bottles) – and try to link them to the help available. 
»»
Make sure vulnerable or marginalized people are not overlooked (see Section 3.5).
»»
Follow up with people if you promise to do so.
2. Help people cope with problems
A person in distress can feel overwhelmed with worries and fears. Help them to consider 
their most urgent needs, and how to prioritize and address them. For example, you can 
ask them to think about what they need to address now, and what can wait for later. 
Being able to manage a few issues will give the person a greater sense of control in the 
situation and strengthen their own ability to cope. Remember to:
»»
help people identify supports in their life, such as friends or family, who can help 
them in the current situation; 
»»
give practical suggestions for people to meet their own needs (for example, 
explain how the person can register to receive food aid or material assistance);
»»
ask the person to consider how they coped with difficult situations in the past, and 
affirm their ability to cope with the current situation;
»»
ask the person what helps them to feel better. Encourage them to use positive 
coping strategies and avoid negative coping strategies (see the following table).
25             Psychological first aid: Guide for field workers
Coping
Everyone has natural ways of coping. Encourage people to use their own positive 
coping strategies, while avoiding negative strategies. This will help them feel stronger 
and regain a sense of control. You will need to adapt the following suggestions to take 
account of the person’s culture and what is possible in the particular crisis situation.
Encourage  
positive coping 
strategies
»»
Get enough rest.
»»
Eat as regularly as possible and drink water.
»»
Talk and spend time with family and friends.
»»
Discuss problems with someone you trust.
»»
Do activities that help you relax (walk, sing, pray,  
play with children).
»»
Do physical exercise.
»»
Find safe ways to help others in the crisis and get  
involved in community activities.
Discourage 
negative coping 
strategies
»»
Don’t take drugs, smoke or drink alcohol.
»»
Don’t sleep all day.
»»
Don’t work all the time without any rest or relaxation.
»»
Don’t isolate yourself from friends and loved ones.
»»
Don’t neglect basic personal hygiene.
»»
Don’t be violent. 
Psychological first aid: Guide for field workers             26

3. Give information
People affected by a crisis event will want accurate information about: 
»»
the event 
»»
loved ones or others who are impacted 
»»
their safety 
»»
their rights 
»»
how to access the services and things they need 
Getting accurate information after a crisis event may be difficult. The situation may 
change as information about the crisis event becomes known and relief measures are 
put in place. Rumours may be common. You may not have all the answers in any given 
moment, but wherever possible:
»»
find out where to get correct information, and when and where to get updates;
»»
try to get as much information as you can before you approach people to  
offer support; 
»»
try to keep updated about the state of the crisis, safety issues, available services, 
and the whereabouts and condition of missing or injured people;
»»
make sure people are told what is happening and about any plans;
»»
if services are available (health services, family tracing, shelter, food distribution), 
make sure people know about them and can access them; 
»»
provide people contact details for services, or refer them directly;
»»
make sure vulnerable people also know about existing services (see Section 3.5). 
27             Psychological first aid: Guide for field workers
In giving information to affected people:
»»
explain the source of the information you are providing and how reliable it is; 
»»
only say what you know – do not make up information or give false reassurances;
»»
keep messages simple and accurate, and repeat the message to be sure people 
hear and understand the information;
»»
it may be useful to give information to groups of affected people, so that everyone 
hears the same message; 
»»
let people know if you will keep them updated on new developments, including 
where and when. 
When giving information, be aware that the helper can become a target of the frustration 
and anger people may feel when their expectations of help have not been met by you or 
others. In these situations, try to remain calm and be understanding.  
4. Connect with loved ones and social support
It has been shown that people who feel they had good social support after a crisis cope 
better than those who feel they were not well supported. Because of this, linking people 
with loved ones and social support is an important part of PFA. 
»»
Help keep families together, and keep children with their parents and loved ones.
»»
Help people to contact friends and relatives so they can get support;  
for example, provide a way for them to call loved ones.
»»
If a person lets you know that prayer, religious practice or support from religious 
leaders might be helpful for them, try to connect them with their spiritual community. 
See the following box for suggestions about crisis situations and spirituality.
»»
Help bring affected people together to help each other. For example, ask people to help 
care for the elderly, or link individuals without family to other community members.
Psychological first aid: Guide for field workers             28
Chapter 3
Crisis and spirituality
In crisis situations, a person’s spiritual or religious beliefs may be very important in 
helping them through pain and suffering, providing meaning, and giving a sense 
of hope. Being able to pray and practise rituals can be a great comfort. However, 
the experience of crisis – particularly in the face of terrible losses – can also cause 
people to question their beliefs. People’s faith may be challenged, made stronger or 
changed by this experience. Here are some suggestions about the spiritual aspects 
of providing care and comfort after a distressing event:
»»
Be aware of and respect the person’s religious background.
»»
Ask the person what generally helps them to feel better. Encourage them to do 
things that help them to cope, including spiritual routines if they mention these. 
»»
Listen respectfully, and without judgment, to spiritual beliefs or questions  
the person may have.
»»
Don’t impose your beliefs, or spiritual or religious interpretations of the crisis, 
on the person.
»»
Don’t agree with or reject a spiritual belief or interpretation of the crisis, even 
if the person asks you to do so.
3.4  Ending your help 
What happens next? 
When and how you 
stop providing help will 
depend on the context of 
the crisis, your role and 
situation, and the needs 
of the people you are 
helping. Use your best 
judgment of the situation, 
the person’s needs and 
your own needs. 
If appropriate, explain to the  
person that you are leaving, and if  
someone else will be helping them from that point on, try and introduce them to that 
person. If you have linked the person with other services, let them know what to expect 
and be sure they have the details to follow up. No matter what your experience has been 
with the person, you can say goodbye in a positive way by wishing them well. 
29             Psychological first aid: Guide for field workers
3.5  People who likely need 
special attention 
People who may be vulnerable and need special  
help in a crisis include:
1.	 Children, including adolescents.
2.	 People with health conditions or disabilities.
3.	 People at risk of discrimination or violence.
Remember that all people have resources to cope, including those who are 
vulnerable. Help vulnerable people to use their own coping resources and strategies. 
1. Children, including adolescents
Many children – including adolescents – are particularly vulnerable in a crisis situation. 
Crisis events often disrupt their familiar world, including the people, places and routines 
that make them feel secure. Children who are affected by a crisis may be at risk of sexual 
violence, abuse and exploitation, which tends to be more common in the chaos of large 
crisis situations. Young children are often particularly vulnerable since they cannot meet 
their basic needs or protect themselves, and their caregivers may be overwhelmed. Older 
children may be trafficked, sexually exploited or recruited into armed forces. Girls and boys 
often face somewhat different risks. Usually girls face the greatest risk of sexual violence 
and exploitation, and those who have been abused may be stigmatized and isolated.
How children react to the hardships of a crisis (for example, witnessing destruction, 
injury or death, being exposed to the elements, lack of food and water) depends on their 
Psychological first aid: Guide for field workers             30
Chapter 3
age and developmental stage. It also depends on the ways their caregivers and other 
adults interact with them. For example, young children may not fully understand what  
is happening around them, and are especially in need of support from caregivers.  
In general, children cope better when they have a stable, calm adult around them. 
Children and young people may experience similar distress reactions as adults do  
(see Section 3.3). They may also have some of the following specific distress reactions4:
»»
Young children may return to earlier behaviours (for example, bedwetting or 
thumb-sucking), they may cling to caregivers, and reduce their play or use 
repetitive play related to the distressing event. 
»»
School-age children may believe they caused bad things to happen, develop new 
fears, may be less affectionate, feel alone and be preoccupied with protecting or 
rescuing people in the crisis.
»»
Adolescents may feel “nothing”, feel different 
from or isolated from their friends, or they 
may display risk-taking behaviour  
and negative attitudes.  
4	 See Pynoos, et al. (2009) in References and resources. 
31             Psychological first aid: Guide for field workers
Family and other caregivers are important sources of protection and emotional support 
for children. Those separated from caregivers may find themselves in unfamiliar places 
and around unfamiliar people during a crisis event. They may be very fearful and may 
not be able to properly judge the risks and danger around them. An important first step is 
to reunite separated children – including adolescents – with their families or caregivers. 
Do not try to do this on your own. If you make mistakes, it will make the child’s situation 
worse. Instead, try to link immediately with a trustworthy child protection agency that 
can begin the process of registering the child and ensuring they are cared for. 
When children are with their caregivers, try to support the caregivers in taking care 
of their own children. The following box gives suggestions for how they can support 
children of different ages and developmental stages. 
Things caregivers can do to help children 
Infants
»»
Keep them warm and safe.
»»
Keep them away from loud noises  
and chaos.
»»
Give cuddles and hugs.
»»
Keep a regular feeding and sleeping  
schedule, if possible.
»»
Speak in a calm and soft voice.
Young 
children
»»
Give them extra time and attention.
»»
Remind them often that they are safe.
»»
Explain to them that they are not to  
blame for bad things that happened.
»»
Avoid separating young children  
from caregivers, brothers and  
sisters, and loved ones.
»»
Keep to regular routines and  
schedules as much as possible.
»»
Give simple answers about what  
happened without scary details.
»»
Allow them to stay close to you if they are fearful or clingy.
»»
Be patient with children who start demonstrating behaviours  
they did when they were younger, such as sucking their thumb  
or wetting the bed.
»»
Provide a chance to play and relax, if possible.
Psychological first aid: Guide for field workers             32
Chapter 3
Things caregivers can do to help children (continued)
Older 
children and 
adolescents
»»
Give them your time and attention.
»»
Help them to keep regular routines.
»»
Provide facts about what happened and explain what is 
going on now.
»»
Allow them to be sad. Don’t expect them to be tough.
»»
Listen to their thoughts and fears without being judgmental.
»»
Set clear rules and expectations.
»»
Ask them about the dangers they face, support them and 
discuss how they can best avoid being harmed.
»»
Encourage and allow opportunities  
for them to be helpful.
If the caregiver is injured, extremely upset or otherwise cannot care for their children, you 
can arrange to get help for the caregiver and care for the children. Involve a trustworthy 
child protection agency or network, whenever possible. Keep children and their caregivers 
together, and try not to let them get separated. For example, if the caregiver is being 
transported somewhere for medical care, try to keep the children with them or take down 
the details of where the caregiver is being taken so they can be reunited.
Also keep in mind that children may gather around a crisis setting and may witness horrific 
events, even if they or their caregivers are not directly affected by the event. In the chaos 
of a crisis, adults are often busy and may not be watching closely what children in the area 
are doing or what they see or hear. Try to shield them from upsetting scenes or stories.

Things to say and do for children 
Keep 
together 
with loved 
ones
»»
Keep them together with their caregivers and family 
whenever possible. Try not to let them get separated. 
»»
When unaccompanied, link them with a trustworthy  
child protection network or agency. Don’t leave the  
child unattended. 
»»
If no child protection agency is available, take steps 
yourself to find their caregivers or to contact other family 
who can care for them.
Keep safe
»»
Protect them from being exposed to any gruesome scenes, 
like injured people or terrible destruction.
»»
Protect them from hearing upsetting stories about the event.
»»
Protect them from the media or from people who want to 
interview them who are not part of the emergency response.
Listen, talk 
and play
»»
Be calm, talk softly and be kind.
»»
Listen to children’s views on their situation.
»»
Try to talk with them on their eye level, and use words and 
explanations they can understand.
»»
Introduce yourself by name and let them know you are 
there to help.
»»
Find out their name, where they are from, and any 
information you can in order to help find their caregivers 
and other family members. 
»»
When they are with their caregivers, support the caregivers 
in taking care of their own children.
»»
If passing time with children, try to involve them in play 
activities or simple conversation about their interests, 
according to their age.
Remember that children also have their own resources for coping. Learn 
what these are and support positive coping strategies, while helping them to avoid 
negative coping strategies. Older children and adolescents can often help in crisis 
situations. Finding safe ways for them to contribute in the situation may help them 
to feel more in control. 
Psychological first aid: Guide for field workers             34
Chapter 3
2. People with health conditions or physical or 
mental disabilities
People with chronic (long-term) health conditions, with physical or mental disabilities 
(including severe mental disorder), or who are elderly may need special help. This may 
include help to get to a safe place, to connect with basic support and health care, or to 
take care of themselves. The experience of a crisis event can make different types of 
health conditions worse, such as high blood pressure, heart conditions, asthma, anxiety 
and other health and mental disorders. Pregnant and nursing women may experience 
severe stress from the crisis that can affect their pregnancy, or their own and their infant’s 
health. People who cannot move on their own, or who have problems seeing or hearing, 
may have difficulty finding loved ones or accessing the services available. 
Here are some things you can do to help people with health conditions or disabilities:
»»
Help them to get to a safe place.
»»
Help them to meet their basic needs, such as being able to eat, drink, get clean 
water, care for themselves, or to build shelter from materials handed out by agencies.
»»
Ask people if they have any health conditions, or if they regularly take medication 
for a health problem. Try to help people get their medication or access medical 
services, when available.
»»
Stay with the person or try to make sure they have someone to help them if you 
need to leave. Consider linking the person with a protection agency or other 
relevant support, to help them in the longer term.
»»
Give them information on how to access any services available.
35             Psychological first aid: Guide for field workers
3. People at risk of discrimination or violence
People at risk of discrimination or violence may include women, people from certain 
ethnic or religious groups, and people with mental disabilities. They are vulnerable 
because they may be:
»»
left out when basic services are being provided;
»»
left out of decisions about aid, services or where to go; and
»»
targeted for violence, including sexual violence. 
People at risk of discrimination or violence may need special protection to be safe in 
a crisis situation, and may need extra help to address their basic needs and access 
available services. Be aware of these people and assist them by:
»»
helping them to find safe places to stay;
»»
helping them to connect with their loved ones and other trusted people; and
»»
providing them with information on available services and helping them to link 
directly with those services when necessary.

Caring for yourself & your 
colleagues
37             Psychological first aid: Guide for field workers
In this chapter, we will discuss: 
4.1	 Getting ready to help.
4.2	 Managing stress: Healthy work and life habits.
4.3	 Rest and reflection. 
You or your family may be directly affected by the crisis situation. Even if you are not 
directly involved, you may be affected by what you see or hear while helping. As a helper, 
it is important to pay extra attention to your own wellbeing. Take care of yourself, so you 
can best take care of others!  
4.1  Getting ready to help
Consider how you can best get ready to be a helper in crisis settings.  
Whenever possible: 
»»
Learn about crisis situations, and 
roles and responsibilities of different 
kinds of helpers.
»»
Consider your own health, and 
personal or family issues that may 
cause severe stress as you take on a 
helping role for others.
»»
Make an honest decision about 
whether you are ready to help in 
this particular crisis situation and at 
this particular time.

4.2  Managing stress: 
Healthy work  
and life habits
 
 
A main source of stress for helpers is day-to-day job stress, particularly during a crisis.  
Long working hours, overwhelming responsibilities, lack of a clear job description, 
poor communication or management, and working in areas which are not secure are 
examples of job-related stress that can affect helpers.  
As a helper, you may feel responsible for people’s safety and care. You may witness or 
even directly experience terrible things, such as destruction, injury, death or violence.  
You may also hear stories of other people’s pain and suffering. All of these experiences 
can affect you and your fellow helpers. 
Consider how you can best manage your own stress, to support and be supported by your 
fellow helpers. The following suggestions may be helpful in managing your stress.
»»
Think about what has helped you cope in the past and what you can do to  
stay strong.
»»
Try to take time to eat, rest and relax, even for short periods.
»»
Try to keep reasonable working hours so you do not become too exhausted. 
Consider, for example, dividing the workload among helpers, working in shifts 
during the acute phase of the crisis and taking regular rest periods. 
»»
People may have many problems after a crisis event. You may feel 
inadequate or frustrated when you cannot help people with all of their 
problems. Remember that you are not responsible for solving all of 
people’s problems. Do what you can to help people help themselves. 
»»
Minimize your intake of alcohol, caffeine or nicotine and avoid non-
prescription drugs.
»»
Check in with fellow helpers to see how they are doing, and have them check 
in with you. Find ways to support each other.  
»»
Talk with friends, loved ones or other people you trust for support.
39             Psychological first aid: Guide for field workers
4.3  Rest and reflection
Taking time for rest and reflection is an important part of ending your helping role. The 
crisis situation and needs of people you have met may have been very challenging, and 
it can be difficult to bear their pain and suffering. After helping in a crisis situation, take 
time to reflect on the experience for yourself and to rest. The following suggestions may 
be helpful to your own recovery.
»»
Talk about your experience of helping in the crisis situation with a supervisor, 
colleague or someone else you trust. 
»»
Acknowledge what you were able to do to help others, even in small ways.  
»»
Learn to reflect on and accept what you did well, what did not go very well, and 
the limits of what you could do in the circumstances. 
»»
Take some time, if possible, to rest and relax before beginning your work and life 
duties again. 
If you find yourself with upsetting thoughts or memories about the event, feel very 
nervous or extremely sad, have trouble sleeping, or drink a lot of alcohol or take 
drugs, it is important to get support from someone you trust. Speak to a health care 
professional or, if available, a mental health specialist if these difficulties continue for 
more than one month.

Practise what you have 
learned
41             Psychological first aid: Guide for field workers
The following case scenarios are examples of crisis 
events you may deal with in your role as a helper. 
As you read these scenarios, imagine:
1.	  What would you need most urgently if something like this happened to you?
2.	  What would you find most helpful?
Keep in mind the PFA action principles of look, listen and link as you imagine how you 
would respond to people in each scenario. We have included some important questions 
to help you think through what to consider and ways to respond. 
5.1  Case scenario 1: Natural disaster
You hear that a large earthquake has suddenly hit the centre of the city in the middle of 
the working day. Many people have been affected and buildings have fallen. You and 
your colleagues felt the shaking, but are okay. The extent of the damage is unclear. The 
agency you work for has asked you and your colleagues to help survivors, and to support 
any severely affected people you encounter. 
Psychological first aid: Guide for field workers             42
Chapter 5
As you prepare to help, ask yourself the following questions:
»»
Am I ready to help? What personal concerns might be important?
»»
What information do I have about the crisis situation?
»»
Will I travel alone or together with colleagues? Why or why not?
Things to consider:
»»
When going to help in a crisis situation – particularly immediately after a 
mass disaster – consider the advantages of working in a team or in pairs. 
Working in teams will help you to have support and back-up in difficult 
situations and is important for your safety. You can also be more effective in 
a team. For example, one person can stay with someone who is distressed 
while the other person can focus on finding special help such as medical 
care, if needed. If possible, try to have a “buddy system” where you and a 
fellow helper can check in with each other for support and help.
»»
Some agencies may be able to give you support, such as supplies, 
transportation, communication equipment, updated information about 
the situation or security issues, and coordination with other team 
members or services.
 
As you move about the city, what should you look for?
»»
Is it safe enough to be at the crisis site?
»»
What services and supports are available?
»»
Are there people with obvious urgent basic needs?
»»
Are there people with obvious serious emotional reactions? 
»»
Who may likely be in need of special help?
»»
Where can I provide PFA? 
As you approach people, how can you best listen to their concerns and give comfort?
»»
What basic needs may affected people have? 
»»
How will I identify and introduce myself to offer support?
»»
What does it mean in this situation to help keep affected people safe from harm?
»»
How will I ask people about their needs and concerns? 
»»
How can I best support and comfort affected people?

Sample conversation with a distressed adult
In this conversation, you have come to a woman standing outside the rubble of 
a fallen building. She is crying and shaking, although she does not appear to be 
physically injured.
You:  Hello, my name is __. I’m working with the agency __. May I talk with you?
Woman:  It’s terrible! I was going into the building when it started shaking! I don’t 
understand what’s happening!
You:  Yes, it was an earthquake and I can imagine it was terrible for you. What is 
your name?
Woman:  I’m Jasmina - Jasmina Salem. I’m very scared! [shaking, crying] I wonder if 
I should go in there and try to find my colleagues? I don’t know if they’re all right!
You:  Ms. Salem, it’s not safe at all to go in the building now, you may get hurt. If you 
like, we can talk just over there where the area is safer and I can sit with you for a 
while. Would you like that? 
Woman:  Yes, please. [You move to a quieter place a short distance away from the 
scene of the fallen building where rescue and medical people are working.]
You:  Can I get you some water? [If available, offer practical comfort like water or a blanket.]
Woman:  I just want to sit here a moment.
[You sit quietly near the woman in silence for two to three minutes, until she begins to 
speak again.]
Woman:  I feel terrible! I should have stayed in the building to help people!
You:  I can understand that.
Woman:  I ran outside. But I feel so badly for the other people!
You:  It’s difficult to know what to do in a situation like this. But it sounds as though you 
acted on good instincts when you ran from the building, or you might have been injured.   
Woman:  I saw them take a body out of the rubble. I think it was my friend! [crying]
You:  I’m so sorry. There is a rescue team working, and we will find out later how 
the people are who were in the building.
Psychological first aid: Guide for field workers             44
Chapter 5
[The conversation continues for another 10 minutes with you listening to the woman’s 
story and asking for her needs and concerns. The conversation wraps up as follows:]
Woman:  I need to find out if my family is all right, but I lost my phone when the 
shaking started, and I don’t know how to get home.
You:  I can help you call your family, and then we can figure out together how you 
can get to them.
Woman:  Thank you. That would help a lot. 
 
In this sample conversation, notice that you:
»»
introduced yourself by name and told the person the agency you work for;
»»
asked the person if they would like to talk;
»»
addressed the person by their name, respectfully using the last name;
»»
protected the distressed person from further harm by moving to a safer place;
»»
offered the distressed person some comfort (for example, some water);
»»
listened and stayed near the person, without forcing them to talk; 
»»
reflected back to the person ways they had acted appropriately;
»»
took the time to listen;
»»
identified the person’s needs and concerns;
»»
acknowledged the person’s worry over the possible loss of colleagues; 
»»
offered to help connect the person with their family members.

resources (food, shelter, water) or services for affected people?
»»
What worries and concerns may be on people’s minds? What practical suggestions 
could I give to help them address their problems?
»»
What information will affected people want? Where will I find updated and reliable 
information about the crisis event?

5.2  Case scenario 2: Violence and 
displacement
Refugees are being brought to a new location in trucks and told that they will be living in 
this new place. They were moved because of the war in their previous area. As they get 
off the trucks, some of them are crying, some appear very fearful, some seem disoriented, 
while others are sighing with relief. Most are afraid and doubtful of this new place, and have 
no idea where they will sleep, eat or receive health care. Some seem scared when they hear 
any loud noise, thinking they are hearing gunfire again. You are a volunteer with an agency 
that distributes food items and have been asked to help out at distribution sites. 
As you prepare to help, consider what you would like to know about this situation:
»»
Who are the people I will be helping? What is their cultural background?
»»
Are there any rules of conduct or customs I need to follow? For example, is it more 
appropriate for women helpers to speak with women refugees?
»»
How far have they travelled? What do I know about the conflict they have experienced? 
»»
What services are being provided in the place the refugees are being received?
»»
If I am working in a team, how will we organize ourselves to help in this situation? 
What tasks will each person take on? How will we coordinate with each other and 
with other groups of helpers who may be there? 
Psychological first aid: Guide for field workers             46

As you encounter the group of refugees, what should you look for?
»»
What will most of the refugees need? Will they be hungry, thirsty or tired? Is 
anyone injured or ill?
»»
Are there families or people from the same village within the refugee group?  
»»
Are there any unaccompanied children or adolescents? Who else may need 
special help? 
»»
Individuals in the refugee group seem to be having different types of reactions to 
the crisis. What kinds of serious emotional responses do you see?
As you approach people among the refugee group, how can you best listen to their 
concerns and give comfort?
»»
How will I introduce myself to offer support? 
»»
People who experienced or witnessed violence may be very frightened and feel 
unsafe. How can I support them and help them feel calm? 
»»
How can I find out the needs and concerns of people who may need special help, 
such as women? 
»»
How will I approach and help unaccompanied children and adolescents?
Sample conversation with an unaccompanied child
At the edge of the refugee group, you notice a boy of about 10 years old standing 
alone and looking very frightened. 
You [getting down on one knee at the eye level of the child]:  Hi, my name is ___. I’m 
with ___agency and I’m here to help. What is your name?
Child [looking down and speaking softly]:  Adam.
You:  Hi Adam. You just had a long ride to get here. Are you thirsty? [Offer something to eat 
or drink or some other practical comfort like a blanket if you have it.] Where is your family?
Child:  I don’t know. [beginning to cry]
You:  I can see you’re scared, Adam. I will try to help you and connect you with 
people who will help to locate your family. Can you tell me your surname and where 
you are from? 
Child:  Yes, I’m Adam Duvall. I’m from __ village.
47             Psychological first aid: Guide for field workers
You:  Thank you, Adam. When is the last time you saw your family?
Child:  My older sister was there when the trucks came to bring us here. But now I 
can’t find her.  
You:  How old is your sister? What is her name?
Child:  Her name is Rose. She’s 15.
You:  I will try to help you find your sister. Where are your parents?
Child:  We all ran from the village when we heard the gunfire. We got lost from my 
parents. [crying] 
You:  I’m sorry, Adam. That must have been scary for you, but you’re safe now. 
Child:  I am scared!
You [in a warm, natural manner]:  I understand. I would like to help you.
Child:  What should I do?
You:  I can stay with you for a while, and we can try to find your sister. Would you like that? 
Child:  Yes, thank you.
You:  Is there anything else worrying you or anything that you need?
Child:  No.
You:  Adam, it is important that we talk with the people over there who can help find your 
sister or other family. I will go with you to talk to them. [It is essential to help the child to 
register with a reputable family tracing or child protection organization, if available.] 
 
In this sample conversation, notice that you:
»»
saw an unaccompanied child in the crowd of refugees;
»»
got down on one knee to speak with the child on his eye level;

5.3  Case scenario 3: Accident
You are travelling on a busy village road in a safe part of the country when up ahead you see 
an accident. It appears a man who was crossing the road with his wife and young daughter 
was hit by a passing car. The man is lying on the ground, bleeding and not moving. His wife 
and daughter are near him. His wife is crying and shaking, while his daughter is standing 
motionless and silent. Some villagers are gathering on the road near the scene of the accident.
You need to react quickly in this situation, but take a moment to stay calm and consider 
the following as you prepare to help:

»»
How will I ask people about their needs and concerns? 
»»
How can I give affected people comfort and help them to feel calm? 
 
 
Sample conversation and actions:  
medical emergency
As you make a quick scan of the accident, you look to make sure you can approach 
the scene of the accident safely. The road is a busy one and there is some traffic still 
passing by the affected people and the onlookers. You are also worried the father 
may be seriously injured. 
You:  Has anybody called for an ambulance?
Villagers:  No.
You [to a nearby villager]:  Could you please call for an ambulance right away?
Villager:  Yes, I will!
Psychological first aid: Guide for field workers             50
Chapter 5
You [to other onlookers]:  We need to try to redirect the traffic. Can you please help 
with this?
[Some villagers go to flag down the passing cars and redirect traffic.]
[As you approach the affected people, you notice one of the villagers is about to move 
the injured man.]
You:  Please don’t move him! He may have an injury to his neck. An ambulance has 
been called.
[If you or someone nearby is trained to do so, give physical first aid to the injured 
man. Check or ask someone around you to help make sure the wife and daughter are 
not injured. Once the injured man is attended to appropriately, and you are sure the 
other affected people are not seriously injured, provide PFA.]
You [to the wife]:  My name is ___. An ambulance has been called. Are you or your 
daughter injured?
Wife [sobbing and shaking]:  No, I’m not hurt.
You [to the wife, calmly and warmly]:  What is your name?
Wife [crying]:  Hanna, you can call me Hanna…Oh, my husband! My husband!
You:  Hanna, I understand that you are very frightened. An ambulance has been 
called to help your husband. I will stay with you for a while. Do you and your 
daughter have any other needs or concerns right now?
Wife:  Is my daughter OK? 
You:  Your daughter does not seem to be injured. Can you tell me her name so I can 
talk to her?
Wife [reaching out to take her daughter’s hand]:  This is Sarah.
You [warmly and on the eye level of the child]:  Hi Sarah. My name is ___. I’m here 
to help you and your mom.
[The conversation continues and you learn that the daughter is not talking. The 
mother says this is unusual for her daughter, but stays focused on her husband. The 
mother also says she wants to go with the father to the hospital to stay with him. The 
daughter is at risk of spending the evening alone at home.]
51             Psychological first aid: Guide for field workers
You:  Hanna, it would be much better if your daughter stays with you or someone 
you trust. She seems to be very frightened by what happened and it is best for her 
not to be left alone right now. Is there someone you trust who could stay with her?
Wife:  Yes, my sister could help. Sarah likes her very much.
You:  Can I help you to call your sister?
Wife:  Yes, please! 
[You help the wife to contact her sister and it is arranged that the daughter will be 
with her aunt for the evening. You also advise the mother to bring the daughter to a 
health clinic if she stays silent over the coming days.]
You:  When the ambulance arrives, I will find out where they will take your husband 
and let you know if you and your daughter can go with them. 
[When the ambulance arrives, you find out how the family can be kept together when 
the injured man is taken to hospital.] 
In this sample conversation and actions, notice that you:
»»
first quickly scanned the crisis situation to be sure it was safe to enter and to see 
who was seriously injured;
»»
made sure an ambulance was called immediately for the injured man, and 
prevented him from being moved and possibly injured further;
»»
tried to work in a way that prevented further harm or danger to others (for 
example, being careful of the traffic in the road);
»»
spoke respectfully and warmly to the wife and daughter;
»»
addressed the child on her eye level;
»»
helped the wife to make appropriate arrangements to look after her daughter; 
»»
took steps to help the family stay together when the injured man was taken to hospital.

What is PFA?  
Psychological first aid (PFA) describes a  
humane, supportive response to a fellow human  
being who is suffering and who may need support.
Providing PFA responsibly means:
1.	 Respect safety, dignity and rights. 
2.	 Adapt what you do to take account of the person’s culture.
3.	 Be aware of other emergency response measures.
4.	 Look after yourself.
PFA Action Principles:
Prepare
»»
Learn about the crisis event.
»»
Learn about available services and supports.
»»

People who may hurt themselves.
»»
People who may hurt others.
