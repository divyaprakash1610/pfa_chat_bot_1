 Insomnia 
 
Healthy Sleep Hygiene 
□ Identify and rid of barriers to restful sleep such as caffeine, long naps, use of electronics at 
bedtime 
 
□ Reduce time in bed awake to increase sleepiness. 
 
□ Stick to a sleep schedule, even on the weekends. 
Bed time: _____________  
 
Wake Time: _____________ 
 
□ Keep your bedroom for sleeping and intimacy, do not work, watch TV, or eat in bed. 
 
□ Do not watch the clock to prevent anxiety or pressure to fall asleep. 
 
□ Avoid caffeine and alcohol close to bedtime. 
 
□ Avoid smoking, especially in the evening since nicotine often disturbs sleep. 
 
□ Avoid greasy or "heavy" foods close to bedtime but ensure your eating habits are regulated 
so hunger does not disturb your sleep. 
 
□ Limit excessive fluid consumption close to bedtime to limit the need for nighttime bathroom 
trips. 
 
□ Get regular exercise to improve sleep quality and increase sleepiness. It is best if you finish 
exercising at least two hours before bedtime. A hot shower or bath after exercise may further 
promote deep sleep. 
 
□ Limit noise distractions by sleeping in a well-insulated room or using ear plugs or a white 
noise source. 
 
□ Keep your room dark and cool. Use light-blocking curtains or eye covers, if needed. 
 
□ Restrict your time in bed to only the amount of sleep you need to feel refreshed the next day 
and limit fragmented, shallow sleep. On average, adults require 7.5-8 hours of sleep each 
night. 
 
□ Reserve an hour before bedtime to wind down. Put away electronic devices and engage in 
relaxing, restful activities like reading or meditation. 
 
□ Do not take problems to bed. If you need time to process your thoughts or plan the next day, 
reserve 15-30 minutes beforehand to make a "worry list" or "To Do list" to address after a 
restful slumber. 
 
□ If you are having difficulty falling asleep, get out of bed. When you try harder to fall asleep, it 
often makes it more frustrating and difficult to do so. Leave the bedroom and do something 
relaxing like reading in dim light. Return to bed only once you feel sleepy and wake up at 
your usual wake time. 
 
Remember these recommendations are to help promote good sleep. If you have a sleeping 
disorder like insomnia, then implementing this healthy sleep hygiene alone may not treat your 
condition. Make sure to discuss your concerns with your doctor.
