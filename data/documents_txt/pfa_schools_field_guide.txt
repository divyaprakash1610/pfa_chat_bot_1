Introduction 
and Overview
The field of school safety and emergency management has evolved significantly over the past decade. Tragically, 
acts of violence, natural disasters, and terrorist attacks have taught us many lessons. We also know that other 
types of emergencies can impact schools, including medical emergencies, transportation accidents, sports injuries, 
peer victimization, public health emergencies, and the sudden death of a member of the school community. We 
now recognize the need for school emergency management plans that are up-to-date and take an “all-hazards” 
approach with clear communication channels and procedures that effectively reunite parents and caregivers with 
students. We have also learned that preparing school administrators, teachers, and school partnering agencies 
before a critical event is crucial for effective response, the value of ongoing training and emergency exercises, and 
that having intervention models that address the public health, mental health, and psychosocial needs of students 
and staff is essential to a safe school environment and the resumption of learning.
What Is Psychological First Aid for Schools?
Psychological First Aid for Schools (PFA-S) is an evidence-informed intervention model to assist students, 
families, school personnel, and school partners in the immediate aftermath of an emergency. PFA-S is 
designed to reduce the initial distress caused by emergencies, and to foster short- and long-term adaptive 
functioning and coping. The principles and techniques of PFA-S meet five basic standards. They are:
1.	 Consistent with research evidence on risk and resilience following trauma 
2.	 Respectful of and consistent with the school administration of the academic setting, school culture, and 
the behavior (code of conduct) of students
3.	 Applicable and practical in field settings 
4.	 Appropriate for developmental levels across the lifespan 
5.	 Delivered in a culturally-informed and flexible manner 
PFA-S assumes that students and staff members may experience a broad range of early reactions (e.g., 
physical, cognitive, psychological, behavioral, spiritual) following an emergency. Some of these reactions can 
cause distress that interferes with adaptive coping, but support from informed, compassionate, and caring 
professionals can help students and staff members recover from these reactions. PFA-S has the potential to  
mitigate the development of severe mental health problems or long-term difficulties in recovery by identifying 
individuals who may need additional services and linking them to such services as needed.

Introduction and Overview
Why Provide Psychological First Aid in Schools?
1.	 Schools are typically the first service agencies to resume operations after a disaster/emergency 
and can become a primary source of community support during and after the incident. Schools are 
where children spend a majority of their day and where they receive substantial support from teachers 
and other staff members, and some schools are the primary setting for psychosocial support and child 
mental health services. In many ways, teachers and staff are the “first and last responders” for children in 
an emergency. Students look to their teachers and to school administrators for leadership and guidance, 
while parents expect and demand that school personnel respond competently and appropriately in such 
situations. In a school-wide emergency, children’s “everyday” school personnel can provide much of the 
intervention needed to stabilize the situation. 
2.	 Preparing for emergencies is critical for all school staff. While school personnel should be prepared 
to respond to high impact/low frequency events such as school shootings, large-scale natural disasters, 
and public health emergencies, they must also be prepared to address smaller scale events that schools 
face each day. Emergency events that do not typically garner national headlines, but do disrupt the 
learning environment, include suicides, transportation accidents, peer victimization, community violence, 
staff or student deaths, injuries on the playground, and infectious diseases. Preparedness involves (1) 
having a comprehensive response and recovery plan, (2) training staff to address the immediate, mid-
term, and long-term needs of students and staff members, (3) frequent practicing of the comprehensive 
response and recovery plan, and (4) evaluation and redesign of plan components that no longer meet 
operational standards for the school. When people are trained in emergency protocols (including 
students, when appropriate) and have knowledge of techniques to reduce anxiety and establish calm, 
they are better able to handle the emergency and be of help to the people affected. 
3.	 Emergencies affect students’ academic and social achievement. Having an effective school 
psychosocial and mental health recovery plan in place, which includes interventions such as PFA-S, 
is critical when emergencies threaten to significantly disrupt the learning environment. Such events 
frequently adversely affected students’ academic and social performance. Counseling services and 
programs addressing students’ developmental needs have traditionally been viewed as supplementary 
services, “add-ons” to the academic mission of the school. However, when students’ psychosocial 
and mental health needs are addressed in a developmental, systematic, and comprehensive manner, 
students achieve at a higher level.
4.	 Trauma-related distress can have a long-term impact if left untreated. Unaddressed mental health 
needs, including those from exposure to violence and other potentially traumatic events, increase dropout 
rates, lower academic achievement, disrupt peer relationships, and impact overall well-being. Thus, 
school mental health initiatives such as PFA-S are not only important for the well-being of children and 
school personnel, but are also critical for the central educational mission of schools.
5.	 Brief interventions can produce positive results that last. A growing body of research shows that 
there are brief, effective interventions that have a long-lasting positive influence on students’ and staff 
members’ trauma-related distress. PFA-S draws from the best available evidence identifying factors that 
promote improved student and staff functioning after disasters and other emergencies.

Introduction and Overview
When Should PFA-S Be Used?
PFA-S is most effective immediately following the incident (e.g., from one hour to a couple of weeks after 
an event). In some circumstances, assuming the safety of students and staff has been ensured, PFA-S can 
be initiated while an incident is still occurring, such as in sheltered-in-place or lockdown situations.
Who Is PFA-S for?
PFA-S is intended for students, school personnel, and their families who have been exposed to a disaster 
or other emergency. Whether an emergency occurs on school grounds or in the community at large, 
schools serve as a central location for professionals to assist children, families, school personnel, and 
school partners. 
Who Delivers PFA-S?
Because it is not psychotherapy, an extended “treatment,” or a stand-alone mental health intervention, 
any staff member, regardless of whether he/she has had mental health training, can deliver aspects of 
PFA-S and can contribute to the school recovery by functioning within the PFA framework. Similarly, 
trained members of community emergency response agencies and mental health professionals may 
provide PFA-S. During and after an emergency, teachers and other staff are a critical link in promoting 
resilience, in recognizing the signs of traumatic stress, and in helping students and their families regain a 
sense of normalcy. For more guidance on how to deliver PFA-S based on your role in the school (principal/
administrator, teacher, health-related professional, support staff), see Appendix A.
What Are the Basic Objectives of the PFA-S Provider?
✔ To establish a positive connection with students and staff members in a non-intrusive, compassionate 
manner
✔ To enhance immediate and ongoing safety and provide physical and emotional comfort
✔ To calm and orient emotionally overwhelmed or distraught students and staff
✔ To help students and staff members identify their immediate needs and concerns
✔ To offer practical assistance and information to help students and staff members address their 
immediate needs and concerns
✔ To connect students and staff members as soon as possible to social support networks, including 
family members, friends, coaches, and other school or community groups
✔ To empower students, staff, and families to take an active role in their recovery, by acknowledging their 
coping efforts and strengths, and supporting adaptive coping
✔ To make clear your availability and (when appropriate) link the student and staff to other relevant 
school or community resources such as school counseling services, peer support programs, 
afterschool activities, tutoring, primary care physicians, local recovery systems, mental health services, 
employee assistance programs, public-sector services, and other relief organizations

Introduction and Overview
How Does PFA-S Fit into Existing School Emergency Plans?
The Emergency Management Cycle in Schools and PFA-S
Whether conducting school vulnerability assessments or adopting an intervention such as PFA-S, schools 
organize safety initiatives based on the four-part emergency management cycle. The four-part emergency 
management cycle includes:
Prevention/mitigation 
phase
Schools both assess and address building security, the safety and integrity of 
facilities, the culture/climate of schools, and the need for secondary prevention 
mental health programs.
Preparedness phase 
Schools facilitate a rapid, coordinated, and effective response in the event of an 
actual emergency by taking the following steps:
•	 Refining emergency management plans and emergency procedures in 
collaboration with key members of the emergency response community (fire 
and police departments, disaster services, and public health)
•	 Periodically reviewing and reinforcing emergency plans and procedures with 
staff
•	 Defining building-level and district-level Incident Command System (ICS) 
structures
•	 Implementing staff trainings on various topics, including parent-student 
reunification and PFA-S
•	 Conducting emergency simulations in collaboration with outside agencies
•	 Developing and regularly updating a list of providers trained in PFA-S
Response phase
Action is taken to effectively contain and resolve an emergency and to decrease 
the potential for such an emergency to escalate. During this phase, the school 
executes the emergency management plan and emergency procedures and 
initiates preliminary activation of the PFA-S teams. Although the response phase 
may have a clear ending point for emergency response agencies, the transition 
into the fourth phase, recovery, may be less distinct.
Recovery phase
Steps are taken to assist students, staff, and their families in the recovery 
process and to restore educational operations in schools. This phase involves 
conducting damage assessments and making repairs, implementing business 
continuity plans, and addressing grief and stress reactions. The very early 
stages of the recovery phase (hours or days after an emergency) are the most 
appropriate time to deliver PFA-S. Depending on the nature of the incident, 
recovery may be a long-term process. PFA-S is an acute intervention; for 
information about longer-term interventions appropriate for students and families 
who have lingering or severe symptoms, go to www.NCTSN.org for a review of 
evidence-based interventions and treatments.
This approach grew from the collaborative efforts of various federal agencies, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the 
U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Safe and Drug Free Schools and its Readiness 
and Emergency Management in Schools program.

Introduction and Overview
The Incident Command System and PFA-S
As suggested above, ICS is a central protocol adopted by schools across the nation. In fact, ICS is mandated 
through the National Incident Management System (NIMS) for any agencies receiving federal funding. It helps 
schools enhance emergency communications and allows them to work with multiple agencies during difficult 
and dangerous circumstances. The ICS is an emergency management structure that: 
1.	 Creates a manageable span of control, ensuring that no one individual oversees too many activities
2.	 Establishes predetermined incident command locations and facilities
3.	 Implements the management of resources
4.	 Ensures integrated communication across multiple organizations
Within the context of an ICS, emergency mental health recovery services occur in a section of the ICS structure known 
as Operations (see figure for a sample of ICS structure). Thus, coordination of PFA-S activities during an emergency 
situation would fall under the direction of the Operations Section Chief who, in turn, reports to the person in charge of 
all emergency response activities, the Incident Commander. Such coordination is critical, given the speed at which 
decisions must be made, information must be shared, and resources must be allocated during an emergency.
Moreover, the Incident Command System is scalable, meaning that it expands and contracts (sections are “activated”) 
only as the situation requires. In a small-scale emergency, only a small portion of the ICS may be engaged. Similarly, 
the individuals serving in certain roles within the ICS may change depending on how the emergency situation unfolds. 
To enter a school site successfully as a PFA-S provider, you will need to work within the framework of the 
school’s ICS, where the roles and decision-making processes have been clearly defined. You will need to 
communicate and coordinate all activities with the authorized personnel or organizations that are managing the 
setting. If you are the team leader, ideally you should be an employee who is regularly onsite, who is a good 
organizer, who is able to delegate, and understands both the referral process and the ICS.

Preparing to Deliver 
Psychological First Aid for Schools
The PFA-S Provider
As a PFA-S provider, you should be aware of the nature of the event, understand the current circumstances, 
and be informed about the type and availability of relief and support services and the school’s ICS. If you are 
providing PFA services on behalf of an outside responding agency, it is critical that you first coordinate with 
the appropriate school officials before you begin delivering services.
Personal and Professional Requirements
Interventions in emergency situations are goal-directed, time-limited, and strength-based. In order to achieve 
a positive outcome, you may encourage survivors to express their concerns and feelings, while at the same 
time containing such emotions within an atmosphere of safety and calm. You may also help survivors to 
identify positive coping strategies.
You should have these professional skills:


Knowledge of and training in the techniques of PFA-S


Ability to assess the ongoing needs of students, staff, and others impacted by the event


Ability to offer age-appropriate and culturally-appropriate intervention strategies 


Knowledge of available resources to which you can refer survivors


Basic understanding of how PFA-S fits within the Incident Command System


Ability to remain within the scope of your expertise and designated role


Ability to pay attention to your own emotional and physical reactions, and practice self-care
Students take their cues from how others are reacting. By demonstrating calm and clear thinking, you can 
help those impacted by the event to know that they can rely on you. Others may follow your lead and remain 
focused, even if they do not feel calm, safe, effective, or hopeful. PFA-S providers often model a sense 
of hope that students and staff cannot yet feel, as they are still attempting to deal with the event and the 
concerns surrounding it.

Preparing to Deliver PFA-S
Learn about the School
When responding to a school incident, take into account the history of the school and its surrounding 
community. Here are some questions for you to consider:
•	 Have there been any previous adverse events at the school (e.g., threats, violence on campus, staff/
student deaths, racism or conflicts with certain ethnic groups)?
•	 Have these adverse events occurred recently and/or frequently? 
•	 Has the school had prior experience with any post-event interventions? If yes, did the administration/staff 
find previous interventions helpful or disruptive?
•	 Have there been any recent events at the school and/or are there any groups functioning within the 
school community that explicitly promote the strength of the school or that serve as a protective factor for 
individuals?
•	 What is the current morale of the school staff and students, and the current “climate” of the school 
community as a whole?
•	 Are there any upcoming events at the school (e.g., dances, standardized testing, graduation, 
accreditation review, sporting events, anniversaries of past events) that might positively or negatively 
affect the recovery of the school community?
•	 Are there any recent changes to school staff (e.g., a new principal, reduction in nursing staff time) that 
may affect response/recovery efforts?
•	 What is the present relationship of the school to the community? What collaborative relationships, 
coalitions, and/or stakeholders exist that support the school?
•	 Are there any members of the school staff who have personal trauma histories that should be taken into 
consideration by those making decisions related to emergency response or recovery procedures?
Identify the Distinguishing Features of the Event
Since every emergency is different, take the nature of the event into account. Before providing services, you 
should know the following:


Location/s of the event/s


Time/s and duration of the event/s 


Magnitude of the event:
–
–
Number of persons injured or dead
–
–
Was it a confined or open area?
–
–
Was it an isolated or crowded area?
–
–
What were the disturbing features of the event (e.g., sexual abuse, mutilation, torture, chemical 
exposure)?

Cause of the event: 
–
–
Accident/man-made

–
Intentional (e.g., act of terrorism, shooting, suicide)


Levels of exposure to the event, including:
–
–
Secondary exposures (e.g., administering first aid to the injured, rescue efforts, additional threats)
–
–
Significance of losses (e.g., students or staff who were particularly prominent in the school)

Be Aware of At-Risk Populations
Students and staff members who are at special risk include those who:
•	 Had direct exposure (e.g., exposed firsthand or experienced extreme life threat)
•	 Have been injured
•	 Have experienced the death or serious injury of a loved one
•	 Had a close personal relationship with any victim(s)
•	 Have a history of depression or suicidal thoughts or attempts
•	 Have a history of anxiety, shyness, or low self-confidence 
•	 Have a history of risk-taking behavior
•	 Have experienced prior traumatic events and are at current risk, including:
–
– Those exposed to community violence or domestic violence
–
– Those with a history of abuse and/or neglect
–
– War or other refugees or political asylees
–
– Members of economically disadvantaged groups
–
– Medically vulnerable individuals
–
– Those from disaster-prone regions
Certain groups of individuals in the school community may mistrust others, feel stigmatized, or fear 
repercussions (e.g., deportation, punishment), in addition to lacking knowledge about recovery services. 
Children of rescuers and first responders may also be at special risk in situations where their parents are in 
danger. Finally, students with an individualized educational plan (IEP) or those who meet the requirements of 
a disability as delineated by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) may need accommodations 
or additional assistance.

Preparing to Deliver Psychological First Aid for Schools
Be Sensitive to Racial and Cultural Diversity
Remember to respect cultural, ethnic, religious, racial, and language differences. Whether providing outreach or 
services, be aware of your personal values and prejudices and how these may agree or conflict with those of the 
school community you are serving. Training in cultural competence can facilitate this awareness. Students and 
staff members are better able to cope when they maintain their traditions, rituals, gender roles, and social bonds.
Guidelines for Delivering PFA-S
✔ Operate only within the framework of an authorized school emergency response system.
✔ Before you approach an individual or a group, first observe politely. 
✔ Initiate contact only after you have determined that you are not intruding or interrupting. 
✔ Offer practical assistance (food, water). This is often the best way to make contact. 
✔ Ask simple, respectful questions to determine how you may help.
✔ Remain flexible and adjust to people and their situations as needed. Do not enter the site with any 
agenda other than providing PFA-S.
✔ Be prepared for those impacted by the event to either avoid you or flood you with contact.
✔ Speak calmly. Be patient, responsive, and sensitive. 
✔ Speak slowly, in simple concrete terms; do not use acronyms or jargon.
✔ Listen carefully when students or staff members want to talk. Focus on understanding (“getting”) what they 
want to tell you, and hearing how you can be of help. Children who are too young to speak, or who may not 
speak clearly, often express their feelings and show what they want through their behaviors, such as play.
✔ Support and reinforce the person’s individual strengths and coping strategies, including the positive 
things he/she has done to stay safe.
✔ Give information that directly addresses the person’s immediate goals, and clarify answers repeatedly as 
needed.
✔ Give information that is accurate and age-appropriate. Remember that even very young children need to 
know what has happened. Tell children the truth, but keep it brief and speak to their developmental level 
(e.g., avoid discussing the details of a death).
✔ Reassure young children that the adults are there to protect them and keep them safe. Even when adults do 
not feel safe, young children need to be assured that everything possible is being done to keep them safe. 
✔ When communicating through an interpreter, look at the person with whom you are talking, not at the 
translator or interpreter. 
✔ PFA-S leaders should reach out to those in positions of authority (e.g., administrators, school resource 
officers) who have been equally exposed but who, due to their position, need to project a sense of calm 
and control to those under their care.
Psychological First Aid for Schools Field Operations Guide
13
Preparing to Deliver Psychological First Aid for Schools
✔ 
Assist support staff (e.g., custodians, bus drivers, food workers, librarians, secretaries, coaches, 
instructional aides) whose emotional needs may be overlooked in emergencies. These staff members, 
who are often involved in directing, calming, and reassuring students and parents, are among the 
important stabilizing factors in students’ lives. 
✔ 
Remember that the goal of PFA-S is to reduce distress, assist with current needs, and promote adaptive 
functioning, not to elicit details of traumatic experiences and losses.
✔ 
Keep in mind that the goal of schools is to support academic achievement. Ask students what they need 
to be able to attend school every day, to complete their work and succeed in school, and to stay safe in 
their lives outside of school. 
Behaviors to Avoid
✘ Do not make assumptions about what students and staff have experienced during the incident or are 
experiencing currently.
✘ Do not assume that everyone who has been through the emergency will be traumatized.
✘ Do not pathologize. Most acute reactions are understandable and expectable, given what students 
and staff have experienced. Do not label reactions as “symptoms” or speak in terms of “diagnoses,” 
“conditions,” “pathologies,” or “disorders.”
✘ Do not talk down to or patronize students or staff. Do not focus on the individual’s helplessness, 
weaknesses, mistakes, or disability. Focus instead on what he/she has done that is effective or has 
contributed to helping themselves or others, both during the emergency and in the present setting. Let 
the student know that continuing to attend school and performing academically shows his/her strength 
and resilience. Highlight to staff that coming to work every day or taking on additional duties shows 
their strength.
✘ Do not assume that all students and staff members want or need to talk to you. Being physically 
present in a supportive and calm way in itself often helps affected people feel safer and more able 
to cope.
✘ Do not “debrief” by asking for details of what happened.
✘ Do not speculate or give information that might be inaccurate. If you cannot answer a question, say so, 
and do your best to learn the facts.
Adapt PFA-S for Students with Disabilities or Other Impairments
Children with special needs, specifically those with a disability who receive accommodation services, may 
not be as responsive to PFA-S techniques and adjustments may be needed. Design and adapt interventions 
to their particular abilities and enlist their teachers and teaching assistants for help. In this way, you will 
contribute to a successful resolution of the situation. Some considerations for different disabilities follow: 
Autism
Children with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), such as Asperger’s Disorder, may be mainstreamed in 
general education classes or in self-contained classrooms depending on their disability and accompanying 
behavioral issues.
National Child Traumatic Stress Network    National Center for PTSD

HOW 
TO 
HELP
These students may be particularly sensitive to new people and to changes in their 
routine or surroundings. If possible, announce changes before they occur. These 
students may have heightened sensitivity to sounds, bright lights, new tastes, smells, 
or cold temperature that may disrupt their emotional equilibrium in response, for 
example, to sirens or alarm bells. Students with ASD may be obsessive or hyper-
focused on some element of the crisis, and they may upset others when they 
perseverate on the details of an event or exhibit self-soothing behaviors such as 
rocking.
Many of these students have behavior plans that include their going to a 
predetermined “safe place” when they are distressed. When possible to do so, allow 
them to follow their behavior plans. They will respond best to a familiar teacher or 
other person in authority who can calmly reassure them of their safety and set firm 
limits on their behaviors.
For students in a self-contained classroom, the most helpful intervention will be a 
return to their normal daily routine. They may not be responsive to new people. For 
many of these students, attempts to teach them exercises meant to help them cope 
may, in fact, increase their distress. 
Learning Disabilities
Children with one or more learning disabilities (such as dyslexia, visual/spatial problems, expressive or 
receptive language disorders, memory deficits) tend to be in general education classes. 
HOW 
TO 
HELP
These children should be responsive to most PFA-S strategies. The nature of the 
learning disability may affect a child’s ability to benefit from a specific exercise. For 
example, a student with a language disability may have difficulty expressing his/
her feelings in writing, or he/she may have difficulty accurately recalling contact 
information such as a phone number and street address. Adapt specific exercises to 
the student’s strengths.
Speech Impairment 
Children with speech and language deficits, including students with language processing issues, tend to be in 
general education classes.
HOW 
TO 
HELP
Students with language deficits may have difficulties with comprehension or with 
verbal expression. These students may respond best to exercises that include 
activities and visual cues, such as artwork, or relaxation strategies that can be 
modeled rather than just described.
Psychological First Aid for Schools Field Operations Guide
15
Preparing to Deliver Psychological First Aid for Schools
Cognitive Impairment 
Students with mental retardation/cognitive delays may be mainstreamed in general education classes or in 
self-contained classrooms, depending on the severity of their disability and accompanying behavioral issues. 
HOW 
TO 
HELP
Similar to students with autism, students with cognitive delays will do best after 
they return to their normal routine. Higher functioning students in general education 
classes may require simpler, more concrete directions, but they should respond to 
most PFA-S strategies.
Emotional Disturbance
Children identified as having an emotional impairment may have a variety of mood (depression, anxiety, anger, 
fear, apathy) and/or behavioral (aggression, withdrawal, hyperactivity, temper tantrums) issues, with the most 
serious disturbances including distorted thinking, excessive anxiety, bizarre motor acts, abnormal mood swings, 
or psychosis. Some of these students will have a trauma history, and the current event may bring up reminders of 
past events that will be unsettling and disruptive. These students, whether mainstreamed in the general population 
or in self-contained classrooms, may act unpredictably and need their teachers and support staff to intervene. 
HOW 
TO 
HELP
While most children with an emotional disturbance status may be responsive to 
the PFA-S techniques you are using, ask their teachers to identify which students 
may be resistant or become distressed. Most of these children will have behavioral 
intervention plans that include options for them to follow in certain circumstances; for 
example, a child who may become out of control is allowed to visit a particular adult 
or engage in a particular activity in order to self-soothe. When possible, try to follow 
the familiar and established routine. If this is not feasible, the child’s teacher, aide, or 
another familiar member of the child’s team should be the one to explain the new plan 
to him/her.
Orthopedic, Hearing, or Visual Impairment
Children with orthopedic, hearing, or visual impairments will often experience an increased sense of 
vulnerability and distress when the unexpected happens. 
HOW 
TO 
HELP
Reassure these children that they are safe, and work with their teachers or aides 
to design or adapt interventions for their needs. Again, their teachers and teaching 
assistants will be best able to help restore calm.
National Child Traumatic Stress Network    National Center for PTSD 
16
Preparing to Deliver Psychological First Aid for Schools
Other Health Impairment
Children will other health impairments (e.g., asthma, epilepsy, diabetes) may have limited strength, vitality, or 
alertness due to chronic or acute health problems. 
HOW 
TO 
HELP
Watch carefully for signs that students are having physical distress. Ask them if they 
are physically okay and if they need any help. Seek appropriate medical attention as 
needed.
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
In a crisis, you may see students with ADHD increase their symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity, 
resulting in out of control behavior. 
HOW 
TO 
HELP
Students with ADHD will benefit from activities that allow for physical movement. 
When giving directions, calmly tell students exactly what you expect, avoid directions 
with more than one or two steps, and give warnings about specific consequences for 
inappropriate behavior.
Implement PFA-S in Groups
PFA-S can be delivered in various group settings, such as in classrooms, with a small group of students, or 
with school staff. It is best to run groups with another provider. 
When meeting with groups, keep the following in mind:
•	 Tailor the discussion to the shared needs and concerns of the group.
•	 Focus the discussion on problem solving and applying coping strategies to immediate issues.
•	 Allow only one person at a time to speak.
•	 Answer questions honestly, but limit the information to what the students and staff can handle and tolerate.
•	 Do not let discussions about concerns lapse into complaints.
•	 Redirect the discussion if it turns to descriptions of gruesome or disturbing details of the emergency. If 
an answer might be upsetting, tell the individual that at this time the information would not be helpful to 
everyone, but that you can discuss it privately later.
•	 If you sense that individuals are becoming anxious or distressed, interrupt and lead the group in a 
relaxation exercise (e.g., ask everyone to be silent and to take a few slow breaths; then refocus the 
conversation). 
•	 If an individual needs further support, offer to meet with him/her after the group discussion.
•	 Keep the focus on creating a supportive environment for each other, with the overall goal of having the 
school return to a healthy learning environment.

Core Action 1: 
Contact and Engagement 
Illustration by Dr. Bob Seaver
Goal
To initiate contacts or to respond to contacts by students and staff in a non-intrusive, 
compassionate, and helpful manner
Your first contact with a student or staff member is an important opportunity to promote a sense of calm, 
hope, and support to those impacted by the event. You may be delivering services in a large setting, such 
as a school gymnasium, classroom, or offsite evacuation field. Make sure the setting has been explicitly 
designated as safe and secure by an emergency response agency and/or as communicated through the 
Incident Command System (ICS).
National Child Traumatic Stress Network    National Center for PTSD 
20
Core Action 1: Contact and Engagement
Making Initial Contact
Keep the following in mind when making initial contact:


Remember that some students, staff, or family members may not seek your help, but may still benefit 
from assistance. Actively engage individuals by walking around the setting and introducing yourself. Try to 
be mindful not to interrupt conversations.


While an entire school or class may have witnessed or been affected by an event, no two individuals are 
likely to be impacted the same way.


Not all individuals will be traumatized or be in need of PFA-S. Expect resilience, but be on the lookout 
for those who appear to be struggling or who are likely to be “at-risk” due to other factors mentioned 
previously. One way is by observing their behavior first, either alone or with their peers.


Reach as many individuals as possible for initial contact, but do not assume that they will all need further 
assistance.


Do not assume that people will respond to you immediately or positively. It may take time for some 
students or bereaved persons to feel a degree of safety, confidence, and trust. 


If an individual declines your offer of help, respect his/her decision and indicate when and where he/she 
can locate a PFA-S provider later on.


One way to engage students and staff is by attending to their basic needs (e.g., passing out water, food). 


Ensure that students and others are able to hear, read, and understand information, regardless of their 
language fluency or their auditory, speech, or cognitive abilities. If working in self-contained classrooms or 
with students with an IEP, have a teacher or aide who regularly works with the student present, if feasible. 


Hysteria spreads like wildfire. If possible, isolate an agitated person from others, but make sure everyone 
who wants assistance receives it.
Provider Alert
•	 Respond first to those who seek you out.
•	 If a number of people approach you simultaneously, make contact with as many as you can.
•	 Giving a brief look of interest and calm concern can be grounding and helpful to people who are 
feeling overwhelmed or confused.
Introduce Yourself/Ask about Immediate Needs  


Introduce yourself, if you have not been introduced by a teacher or other staff member, by giving your 
name and title, and describing your role. 


Ask for permission to explain how you might be of help. 
Psychological First Aid for Schools Field Operations Guide
21
Core Action 1: Contact and Engagement


Speak calmly and slowly. 


Refrain from looking around or being distracted. 


Ask about any pressing problem that needs immediate attention. 


Give priority to urgent medical concerns and immediately relay them to the PFA-S Team Leader via phone 
or radio. The Team Leader, in turn, should seek resources from the Operations Section Chief. If phone or 
radio are not available, then relay the information via a staff member or a designated student “runner.” 


If you speak with a child in significant distress, contact a teacher, school counselor, parent, or caregiver 
as soon as possible to let him/her know about your conversation so he/she can provide additional support 
to the child.
To make initial contact, you might say:
Staff/Family Members
Hello. My name is ___________. I work with __________ and I am part of the 
school-based mental health recovery team. 
I’m checking in with staff/family members to see how they are doing, and to see 
if I can help in any way. Is it okay if I talk to you for a few minutes? May I ask your 
name? Mrs. Williams, before we talk, is there something that you need right now?
Adolescent 
My name is ___________. I work with __________ and I am part of the 
school-based mental health recovery team. I am touching base with students 
to see how they are doing and find out what they need. Is it okay if I talk to 
you for a few minutes?
Child
(Get on child’s eye level, smile and greet the child, using her/his name and 
speaking calmly.)
Hi, Lisa. My name is ___________. I am working with Mr./Ms./Teacher 
__________ to help you and your family/classmates. Is there anything you 
need right now? Are you warm enough? Do you want a drink or some food?
Culture Alert
The type of physical or personal contact considered appropriate may vary from person to person and across 
cultures and social groups, for example, how close to stand next to someone, how much eye contact to 
make, or whether or not to touch someone, especially of the opposite sex.
Do: 
✔ Look for clues that indicate an individual’s need for “personal space.”
✔ Seek guidance about the most common and important cultural norms from school or community 
cultural leaders who best understand local customs. Also ask about cultural variations, both between 
distinctive groups and within groups, to avoid stereotypes.
✔ Ask the person what cultural traditions or rituals are important to him/her. 
(continued on next page)
National Child Traumatic Stress Network    National Center for PTSD 
22
Core Action 1: Contact and Engagement
Culture Alert (continued)
Don’t:
✘ 
Use sustained eye contact or stand too close to an individual unless he/she initiates such contact.
✘ 
Touch the individual unless you have asked permission. Only touch in a way that cannot be 
misinterpreted by others.
✘ 
Make assumptions about the individual’s culture, race, nationality, or belief system.
✘ 
Expect all members of a group to be too similar in their beliefs and behaviors.
Initiating Contact and Engagement by Setting
PFA-S needs to be adapted depending on the setting where you deliver the services. For specific guidelines 
for assemblies, classrooms, and small groups, see Appendix B. 
Provider Alert
We distinguish between delivering PFA-S to small groups in large, open settings (groups organized in an 
evacuation field or multiple groups in a gymnasium) and attempting to deliver PFA-S to large groups of 
students all at once. We strongly discourage delivering PFA-S or any other intervention to large groups of 
individuals, as it may be particularly harmful, given how quickly intense emotions may spread.
If possible avoid large group settings—such as an auditorium—when you need to deliver emotionally sensitive 
information, even if it is just limited to updates on the emergency. Many administrators may choose to hold 
a large, all-school gathering immediately after an emergency because of its convenience and the perception 
that information can be delivered accurately to large groups. The reality is that, in an emotionally charged 
environment, one message will be heard many different ways and may easily become distorted. Similarly, 
strong emotions expressed in a large group setting may cause unnecessary distress. 
For parent-student reunification sites and student assembly areas, ensure that private rooms or discrete 
locations are available to deliver PFA-S to particularly vulnerable individuals. When entering these areas, first 
observe how individuals or groups are functioning to determine the level of need. Typically, giving regular and 
accurate updates helps to reduce anxiety. However, if the situation is still unfolding, updated information may 
not be available yet. In these situations, help students and families cope with their anxieties and fears, and 
clarify any misinformation. Staying calm is critical. Identify students with special needs and determine whether 
a familiar adult or staff member is available to provide additional support.
In situations in which small groups of students and staff gather informally or in classroom settings, the 
purpose of these meetings is not to discuss the details of the event. In most situations, these individuals will 
have had varying experiences. Exposure to individuals sharing explicit details of the event by those who 
have had limited experience of the event may cause unnecessary distress. PFA-S providers can organize 
small groups of individuals with similar experiences, such as all students who were injured, or friends of the 
deceased, to create a place for more detailed discussions to occur. 
Psychological First Aid for Schools Field Operations Guide
23
Core Action 1: Contact and Engagement
Putting PFA into Practice 
An elementary school principal requested help after one of his students was hit and killed by a car over 
the weekend. A safe room was established where students could go if they were feeling overwhelmed or 
needed to be with friends. One student was observed sitting in a corner, apart from the others, extremely 
upset. A teacher quietly walked over and sat with her. When the student appeared calmer, the teacher 
asked if she could talk with her. The student initially refused, so the teacher asked if she could continue 
to sit next to her. After a few minutes, the student began discussing how the loss of her friend was so 
overwhelming to her.
The teacher said little, but was able to comfort the student through observation, body language, 
and quiet support.
Protect Confidentiality
Given the lack of privacy in some school settings, you may find it challenging to try to protect the 
confidentiality of students, staff, and families after an emergency. However, it is important that you maintain 
the highest level of confidentiality possible. As a provider of PFA services in a school setting, you likely belong 
to a category of mandated reporters and must abide by state abuse and neglect reporting laws. You should 
be aware of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the provisions related to 
disaster and terrorism. Similarly, you should be aware of privacy and information-sharing concerns associated 
with the Federal Educational Records Protection Act (FERPA), particularly as these relate to the sharing of 
information about students who are deemed a potential harm to themselves or others.
If you have questions about releasing information, your PFA-S team leader should discuss this with school 
administration and determine if this needs to be further reviewed by the school’s legal counsel. Talking to 
co-workers about the challenges of working in the post-emergency environment can be helpful, but any 
discussions need to preserve confidentiality.

Core Action 2: 
Safety and Comfort 
Illustration by Dr. Bob Seaver
Goal
To enhance immediate and ongoing safety, and provide physical and emotional 
comfort
Restoring a sense of safety and giving physical and emotional comfort in the immediate aftermath of an 
emergency can begin to reduce distress and worry for students and staff members. When you can give 
individuals some sense of predictability, they regain a feeling of security and control.
Keep in mind that the primary responsibility for maintaining the safety of the school community rests with the 
school administration and staff. In other words, if you are working on behalf of an outside responding agency, you 
must first coordinate with the appropriate school officials before providing any information to students or staff.
National Child Traumatic Stress Network    National Center for PTSD 
26
You can provide comfort and increase sense of safety in a number of ways, including helping students, staff, 
and their families to:   


Do things that are:
–
–
Active (rather than passive waiting)
–
–
Practical (using available resources)
–
–
Familiar (drawing on past experience)
–
–
Soothing (calming and relaxing, easy on the nerves)


Get current, accurate, and up-to-date information, while avoiding exposure to information that is 
inaccurate or excessively upsetting


Get information about how responders are making the situation safer
Ensure Immediate Physical Safety
If you are providing PFA in a school setting where there may still be either a real or perceived threat to safety, 
make sure that everyone is physically safe to the extent possible. If necessary, reorganize the immediate 
environment to increase both physical and emotional sense of safety. Immediately report any safety concerns. 
For example:


Find the appropriate officials who can resolve safety concerns beyond your control, such as threats or weapons.


If clearly safe to do so, remove clutter or damaged equipment from the area where you are working. Let 
the PFA-S Team Leader or the Operations Section Chief coordinating response efforts know if there are 
sharp objects, spilled liquids, broken glass, or other dangerous items that need removal. 


Ask students, staff members, or caregivers if there are special medical concerns, medical devices, or 
medications that individuals may need. If yes, contact a school nurse, medical team leader, or relative. 
Other safety concerns involve:


Threat of harm to self or others – Look for signs that students or family members may hurt themselves 
or others (e.g., students expressing intense anger or agitation). If you need additional support or are not 
trained to assess at-risk individuals, get help by contacting medical or mental health personnel, an EMT, 
or security to handle the situation.


Shock – Seek immediate medical support if an individual is showing signs of shock or has these symptoms: 
pale, clammy skin; weakness or rapid pulse; dizziness or irregular breathing; dull or glassy eyes; is 
unresponsive to communication; lacks bladder or bowel control; or shows restlessness, agitation, or confusion. 
Provide Information about Response Activities and Services
Students and staff need to understand the broader context of response activities occurring at the school 
and in the community. When even the most minimal of predictable schedules or activities is reestablished, 
individuals begin to feel more stable. 
Core Action 2: Safety and Comfort
Psychological First Aid for Schools Field Operations Guide
27
Provide information about:


What to do next


The status, if known and if safe, of their classmates, teachers, other school staff, and relatives who may 
also be in the school


What is being done to assist them


What is currently known about the unfolding event


The support services available to them and their families


When and where school services will be resumed


The best way to get updated information about the situation in the hours or days ahead
In providing information:


Make sure school authorities have granted permission to share event-specific information, such as the 
circumstances of the current situation, the names of those directly affected by event, and when school 
services will resume.


Use your judgment as to whether and when to present specific information. 


Use clear and concise language while avoiding technical jargon.


Position yourself, when feasible, at eye level with the individual.


Use a calm, reassuring tone of voice and give the person time and space to talk.


Provide accurate information, in easy to understand terms, to young students, about who will be supervising 
them and what to expect next. Consider using visual cues and materials to illustrate your information. 


Consider when talking to students:
–
–
Is it appropriate to share this information given his/her age?
–
–
Does he/she appear able to comprehend what you are saying?
–
–
Is he/she ready to hear the content of what you are saying?
Remember:


Address immediate needs and concerns to reduce fears, answer pressing questions, and support 
adaptive coping.


Students, staff, and family members may be getting information from many sources of technology (texting, 
Twitter, Facebook, TV, radio, phone, Internet). Ask about what they have heard or read and address any 
misinformation or distressing information.


Do not guess or invent information if you do not know it in order to provide reassurance. Instead, develop 
a plan, with those you are helping, to get them the information.

Core Action 2: Safety and Comfort


Do not reassure people of the availability of goods or services (e.g., shelter, medicines, donations) unless 
you know that such goods and services will be available.


When working with families, be sure to include children in discussions and in sharing information if it is 
appropriate. Do not just speak to the parent or caregiver. When children are left out of discussions, they 
may feel more insecure.
Examples of what you might say include: 
Parent/Caregiver
A parent-student reunification area has been set up on the football field. At 
this location, you can get updated information about the situation. There is 
also food and water. When the students are released, they will go to this 
location. Do you need directions? Do you have any other questions?
Group of Students 
Here’s what’s going to happen next. When your class is released, we will 
walk over to the football field, where your parents and the buses will be 
waiting. The principal informed me that we’re currently safe. Do you have any 
questions right now?
Individual Student
We’re working hard to make you and the rest of the school safe. I was 
informed by the principal that we have to stay here to keep us safe. Your 
parents have been notified and are waiting on the football field. When I am 
told it is okay, we will walk over together. Do you have any other questions?
Attend to Physical Comfort


Look for simple ways to make the physical environment more comfortable. 


Make sure that the area in which you will work with the students or staff is accessible for individuals with 
disabilities, has minimal distractions, is warm, has good lighting, and has areas where you can speak 
privately.


Help students and staff to soothe and comfort themselves and others around them.


Keep young children with staff members who are familiar to them. When available, give them toys that 
they can hold and take care of to help them soothe themselves. 


Encourage students and staff to participate in getting things they need for comfort (offer to walk over to 
the food area with the person rather than retrieve food for him/her). Taking action helps reduce feelings of 
helplessness and dependency.
Address Media and Social Networking Safety Concerns
In addition to securing their physical safety, protect individuals from unnecessary exposure to additional 
potentially traumatic events and reminders, including sights, sounds, or smells that may be frightening. This 
includes media and social networking information.
Psychological First Aid for Schools Field Operations Guide
29
Core Action 2: Safety and Comfort


Point out that excessive viewing of media coverage may not only upset them, but may also subtly re-
traumatize them. 


Discourage teachers and other staff from ongoing media viewing in and outside the classroom.


Remind them that some reports may not be accurate and identify where they can get reliable and up-to-
date information.


Many individuals may use the Internet, texting, and/or social networking (e.g., Twitter, Facebook) to 
share information. Be aware that the amount of emergency information being shared through these 
technologies will be out of your control, but it is important to monitor what is being communicated. For 
example, students often develop a “memorial page” on Facebook when a member of the community is 
injured or died. Regularly monitor this page to see if disturbing details or misinformation are being posted. 
Notify the administrator about this site so that he/she can delete any inappropriate posts.


Be proactive by encouraging school officials to post accurate information and psychoeducational material 
(including recommendations for where to seek assistance) on these forums, on other social media sites, 
and on official websites as soon as possible. 


Encourage students to ask questions or share information they have learned from these forums with 
trusted adults. Ask students what they heard or what they know about the situation to help you start the 
discussion.


Shield students from reporters, onlookers, and attorneys, in order to help protect their privacy. Many 
schools have a clear policy not to allow their students to be interviewed by the media during an 
emergency. If the policy does allow for interviews, remind students that they may decline a media 
interview or have an adult they trust with them, if they choose to participate.
Provider Alert
It is very natural for students to seek out information through the media. At times, however, they may 
become fixated on it. While such behavior may be a protective factor—in that children are seeking to 
understand the event, learn more, put it into context, and avoid further danger—such behavior can also 
evoke fear and distress. You should tell teachers, parents, and other caregivers that: 
•	 They should monitor and limit children’s exposure to the media, and discuss any concerns the 
children have. Encourage them to regularly check in to keep communication open. 
•	 They can let children know that they are keeping track of information and that they should come to 
them for updates.
•	 Young children are often confused by repeated media coverage and assume that the events that they 
see in the media are happening over and over again.
•	 They should be careful about adults watching media reports if children are in the same or an adjacent 
room, as children can overhear and become confused and frightened by what they learn. 
•	 For parents, suggest that they may consider watching or listening to limited, carefully selected news 
with their children and then discussing the information together afterwards. This will help children 
process the event and allow them to see their family members as protective and supportive.

Core Action 2: Safety and Comfort
Examples of what you might say include:
Teacher/Other Staff
It’s a good idea to shield yourself and your students from further frightening or 
disturbing sights and sounds as much as possible. Even televised scenes or 
pictures can be very disturbing to children. It doesn’t hurt for adults to take a 
break from all the media coverage, too.
Adolescent/Child 
You’ve been through a lot already. Kids often want to watch TV a lot or go 
online after something like this, but that can be more upsetting and not very 
helpful. It’s best to stay away from media reports that show this stuff. If you 
happen to see something that bothers you, be sure to tell your parents, your 
teacher, or another trusted adult.
Attend Funerals and School Memorials to Monitor Those at Risk
In conjunction with school officials, consider how funerals and school memorials may serve as trauma reminders 
for students and staff. Although there are many concerns associated with holding school-wide functions to 
memorialize a violent event or accident, some schools still choose to hold them. A PFA-S provider should always 
be present at such events. The potential for memorial events to re-traumatize is real, particularly for elementary 
students. Take care during the event to monitor those in attendance, engage them in a sensitive way, and 
provide psychoeducational materials. While it is helpful to provide psychoeducational materials to attendees of 
memorials and to high-risk students on anniversary events, it is never appropriate to do so at funerals.
During funerals and school memorials, some individuals who were not close to the event but who have experienced 
similar loss in their lives or have other risk factors may become extremely upset. Those at risk may include those 
having pervasive fantasies about reuniting with the individual who has died or those who have a history of:


Attempted suicide


Substance abuse 


Severe depression or other mental illness


Violent behavior, particularly when combined with access to weapons
After providing immediate assistance when these individuals become upset, collaborate with other providers 
to monitor them in the days and weeks following the event. Reactions may linger and it is important for these 
individuals to know that there are supports and resources available to them.
Provider Alert
Permanent memorials should be avoided. A school community is a dynamic process, and often 
the emotional significance of a memorial is lost over time. Unless the event was of major historical 
significance to the community, future generations of students and staff should not be constricted, 
however slightly, by tragedies of the past. Similarly, schools should avoid living memorials, such as trees 
or flower gardens, as their ongoing maintenance or health may become an issue.

Core Action 2: Safety and Comfort
Address Personal Belongings, “Empty Chairs,” and Temporary Memorials
Although it is important to protect students and staff from being constantly reminded of an event or becoming too 
emotional, do allow individuals to grieve at their own pace. Many well-intentioned adults quickly remove all traces of 
a teacher or student who has died; however, many students/staff members want to honor the life of the deceased.


Do not immediately remove pictures of the deceased that are displayed in the classroom or school.


Do not immediately place another student in the desk/seat of the person who has died.


Do allow students to talk about their memories of the person who has died. If a student’s focus on the 
deceased persists and later interferes with functioning, he/she may be encouraged to speak to a family 
member or professional outside of the classroom.


Prior to any emergencies, schools should work with their school board and the community to establish 
procedures for accepting donations, as well as for removing temporary memorials. For example, schools may 
have a pre-designated, temporary, in-school memorial site where flowers, poems, cards, and photographs can 
be collected and displayed. However, schools should clearly communicate from the start that such memorials 
are temporary and will be in place for a limited time, and that after that time the items will be collected and 
given to the deceased individual’s family. Consider having a well-respected representative of the student body 
assist in this process, to provide a sense of closure and respect for the student body as a whole. The school 
should work with the family if online memorials are created in order to monitor these sites for at-risk individuals.
Help Students/Staff with Grief
Culture Alert 
Beliefs and attitudes about death, funerals, and expressions of grief are strongly influenced by family, culture, 
religious beliefs, and rituals related to mourning. Learn about the cultural norms of the student and staff 
through the assistance of community cultural and school leaders who best understand local customs. Even 
within cultural and religious groups, beliefs and practices can vary widely. Do not assume that all individuals in 
a given group will believe or behave the same way. You should allow individuals to engage in their traditions, 
practices, and rituals in order to provide mutual support for each other, to seek meaning, to manage the range 
of emotional responses and death-related adversities they may experience, and to honor the death appropriately.
Acute Grief Reactions are likely to be intense and prevalent among those who have suffered the death 
of a loved one or close friend. They may feel shock, disbelief, sadness, and anger; feel responsible for not 
preventing the death; regret not providing comfort or having a proper leave-taking; or miss the deceased 
and wish for reunion (including having dreams of seeing the person again). Although painful to experience, 
grief reactions are healthy responses that reflect the significance of the death. Over time, grief reactions tend 
to include more pleasant thoughts and experiences, such as telling positive stories about a loved one and 
remembering him/her in comforting ways. 
National Child Traumatic Stress Network    National Center for PTSD

Core Action 2: Safety and Comfort
Provider Alert
Children’s and adolescents’ understanding of death varies depending on age and prior experience with 
death, and is strongly influenced by family, religious, and cultural values. 
Preschool children may not understand that death is permanent and may believe that if they wish it, the 
person will come back. They need help to confirm the physical reality of a person’s death—that he/she is 
no longer breathing, moving, or having thoughts, and feels no discomfort or pain. They may worry about 
something bad happening to another family member. It may be helpful to explain death to young children 
through the use of storybooks (see www.NCTSN.org for a list of commonly used books). 
School-age children understand the physical reality of death, but may picture death as a monster or a 
skeleton. In longing for the loved one’s return, they may feel an upsetting “ghostlike” presence of the lost 
person, but not tell anyone. 
Adolescents generally understand that death is irreversible. Losing a family member or friend can trigger 
rage and impulsive decisions, such as quitting school, running away, or abusing substances. These 
issues need prompt attention by the family and/or school.
When speaking to adults about how to help children, you can say:
Adult
It can be helpful to think about times when children will miss their friend, for 
instance, at recess or in class. Say something like, “It is hard not to have Suzie 
here and I know a lot of us are missing her right now,” to ease their discomfort, 
make them feel less alone, and help them to handle these difficult times better.
When you see a sudden change in the children—looking lost, sad, or even 
angry—and you suspect that they are missing their friend, let them know 
that you, too, have times when you feel that way. Say something like, “I’m 
wondering if you’re thinking about Suzie. Many of us are thinking about her, 
too. There are many feelings that may come up. What are you feeling? I am 
happy to talk with you or we can connect you to the school counselor, too.”
When working with acutely bereaved individuals, remember that:


The person should be treated with dignity, respect, and compassion. 


Grief reactions will vary from person to person.


What they are experiencing is understandable and expectable, given the loss.


There is no “correct” course of grieving; how a person grieves is dependent not only on his/her cultural 
and religious beliefs, but also on his/her developmental level.


You can explain that they will most likely continue to experience periods of sadness, loneliness, or anger. 


Grief puts older children and adults at risk for abuse of over-the-counter medications, smoking, alcohol, 
drug usage, and depression and suicidal thoughts. 


Students and staff should be made aware of the above risks, the importance of self-care, and the 
availability of professional help.
Psychological First Aid for Schools Field Operations Guide
33
Core Action 2: Safety and Comfort
Watch for individuals who may present with irrational blame, fear, or other strong emotions and who may 
require longer-term attention and more intensive services. Work closely with school administrators to provide 
outreach actively throughout the school, particularly in large-scale emergencies and/or during memorials or 
anniversaries, to find those students and staff who may need assistance but may not seek help. Some may 
feel guilty because they survived while others did not. They may believe that they caused the death in some 
way. Try to help dispel students’ sense of responsibility and assure them that, in events like this, they are not 
to blame for what happened. If an individual continues to feel this way, work on getting him/her additional 
assistance.
To emphasize the importance of understanding and respecting each other’s course of grief, you may say:
Adult/Student
Each person will express his or her grief differently. Some may not cry, 
while others cry a lot. Some may want to talk, while others don’t. No one 
should feel bad about this or think there is something wrong with someone 
who expresses grief in an unfamiliar way. What is most important is to 
respect the different ways each person feels and help each other in the 
days and weeks ahead.
Some individuals will not have words to describe their feelings of grief, and may resist talking with others 
about how they feel. Sometimes distracting activities, such as drawing, listening to music, or reading, will be 
more calming than conversation. For those who wish to be alone, provide them with some privacy if it is safe 
to do so. When a student or adult does want to talk with you about the loved one, listen quietly and do not feel 
you need to say much. Do not probe. 
Do Not Say:
✘ I know how you feel.
✘ It was probably for the best.
✘ He is better off now. 
✘ It was her time to go.
✘ At least he went quickly.
✘ Let’s talk about something else.
✘ You are strong enough to deal with this.
✘ Be glad he passed quickly.
✘ It’s good that you are alive.
✘ You’ll feel better soon.
✘ You did everything you could.
✘ You need to grieve.
✘ You need to relax.
✘ That which doesn’t kill us makes us stronger.
✘ It’s good that no one else died.
✘ It could be worse; you still have a brother/sister/
mother/father.
✘ Everything happens for the best according to a 
higher plan.
✘ Someday you will have an answer.
✘ (To a child) You are the man/woman of the house 
now.
✘ You should work towards getting over this.
If the grieving person says any of the above things, you can respectfully acknowledge the feeling or thought, 
but do not initiate such statements.

Core Action 2: Safety and Comfort
Provide Additional Support to Staff
Teachers and other staff may have additional adversities that affect them. Teachers feel protective of the 
students in their classes. Secretaries and receptionists frequently field phone calls from worried parents, 
the media, and others. Custodians feel responsible for the physical building, and often have the burden of 
cleaning up the physical evidence of the event. Security guards must direct frightened, concerned people 
while remaining calm themselves. 
In the event of an emergency, school staff instinctively put the students first. More frequently than not, staff 
go on “autopilot,” reacting with swiftness to ensure the students’ safety, whether this means moving them 
to another location, securing the doors of a classroom to prevent further violence, aiding in escape, and/or 
protecting students from disturbing visual images. Do not assume that a staff member who appears focused 
and active is not worried about his/her personal safety and emotional reactivity. The majority of staff will 
contain their reactions for the sake of their students’ well-being.
Take time to meet with staff, either in groups or individually, in a private space that is apart from the students. 
Be certain that there is a box of tissues in the room and, if possible, food and beverages. Update staff about 
the situation, plans, and safety of the school community. As you work with staff:


Promote a sense of safety and provide psychoeducation about emotional reactions.


Acknowledge fears and worries about personal safety or health issues.


Find out what staff may specifically need and try to provide it.


Secure the use of a landline telephone, cell phone, or email, as much is possible, so that they can contact 
and reassure family members that they are safe.


Demonstrate calming techniques, such as slow breathing, thought stopping, or grounding.  


Compliment their professionalism, protective instincts, and fast thinking.


Recommend limiting “second guessing” or reevaluating their actions “in hindsight.” 
Putting PFA into Practice 
After the suicide of a student, an event that many individuals in the school community witnessed, teachers 
immediately focused on the safety of their students—quickly moving them to an adjoining building, 
comforting them, and attending to their needs. The adults were also shaken, confused, and upset, but did 
not show these reactions in front of the students. Once the students were released from school, a private 
room was designated and the adults were organized into small groups, where providers could determine 
their physical or emotional concerns, answer their questions, reassure them, and attend to their needs. 
School staff began to feel calmer and safer as the providers exhibited sensitivity to their needs 
and attended to their well-being.

Stabilization 
Illustration by Dr. Bob Seaver
Goal
To calm and orient emotionally overwhelmed or disoriented students and school 
staff
Students and adults whose reactions are so intense and persistent that they significantly interfere with the 
ability to function are of the most concern and may require stabilization. Stabilization is used immediately after 
an event to help calm an individual who appears disoriented or extremely agitated. 
In many instances, students and staff may be numb rather than overly agitated, and they may appear at first 
to be reacting normally to the event. Watch carefully to see whether these individuals also demonstrate signs 
of being connected to (aware of or interactive with) their surroundings or people in the vicinity. If they do not, 
attempt to stabilize them immediately and seek out a health or mental health professional for help. 
National Child Traumatic Stress Network    National Center for PTSD 
36
Core Action 3: Stabilization
REMEMBER
–
– Most individuals affected by school emergencies will not require stabilization. 
–
– Strong emotions, numbing, and anxiety are expected short-term responses to traumatic stress; they 
do not necessarily signal the need for additional intervention beyond standard support. 
–
– If medical or mental health professionals are available, seek them out for help.
Adults, adolescents, or school-aged children who need stabilization may be: 
•	 Disoriented: engaging in aimless disorganized behavior 
•	 Disconnected: numb; startlingly unaffected by the event
•	 Confused: not able to understand what is happening around them; not making sense 
•	 Panicked: extremely anxious; unable to settle; their eyes wide and darting 
•	 Hysterical: sobbing uncontrollably; hyperventilating; rocking 
•	 Excessively preoccupied: unable to think about anything else
•	 In denial: refusing to accept that the event took place
•	 In physical shock: not being able to move; frozen
•	 Glassy-eyed and staring vacantly; unable to find direction
•	 Unresponsive to verbal questions or commands
•	 Exhibiting frantic searching behavior
•	 Feeling incapacitated by worry
•	 Engaging in risky activities
Young children who need stabilization may be: 
•	 Staring blankly
•	 Unresponsive
•	 Displaying behaviors they had outgrown (e.g., urinating in inappropriate places, sucking a thumb)
•	 Screaming
•	 Crying or sobbing uncontrollably
•	 Hyperventilating
•	 Moving in an agitated way (thrashing, pushing away)
•	 Hiding (in a corner or under a table)
•	 Clinging excessively
Approach Distressed Individuals 
If the person is too upset, agitated, withdrawn, or disoriented to talk, or if he/she shows extreme anxiety, fear, 
or panic, consider the following:
Psychological First Aid for Schools Field Operations Guide
37
Core Action 3: Stabilization
Q: If a student, is there a 
caregiver available?
Yes – Make sure this adult appears stable. Focus on empowering 
the caregiver in his/her role of calming the child. Reassure the 
caregiver that you are available to assist.
No – A familiar staff person may serve to help a child regain control.
Q: Is there a staff member who 
knows the student or adult 
well enough to provide 
emotional support?
Yes – Have that person take the student or adult to a quiet place. 
Let the staff member know you are available to help.
No – You should help the person. Do not forget to remain calm 
yourself. Follow the steps below.
Caution: Do not simply try to convince the person to “calm down” 
or to “feel safe.” Neither tends to be effective.
Support Distressed Individuals 
For adults, adolescents, and school-aged children


Respect the person’s privacy and give him/her a few minutes before you intervene. Say you will be 
available if he/she needs you, or that you will check back in a few minutes to see how he/she is doing and 
whether there is anything you can do to help at that time.


Remain calm, quiet, and present, rather than trying to talk to him/her directly, as your questioning may 
contribute to cognitive and/or emotional overload. 


Remain available, while giving him/her a few minutes to calm down.


Stand nearby as you talk to other individuals, do some paperwork, or do other tasks, watching to see if 
the person needs or wishes help.


Offer support and help him/her focus on specific manageable feelings, thoughts, and goals.


Give information that orients him/her to the surroundings, such as how the setting is organized, what will 
be happening, and what steps he/she may consider.


Clarify any misinformation or misunderstanding about what is taking place, while helping to curtail rumors.


Attempt to determine what the student or adult is experiencing, so that you can address the individual’s 
immediate concern or difficulty.
For young children


Remain calm, quiet, and reassuring. Sit with the child at eye level as you speak in a low tone and in a 
reassuring manner. 


Reassure and calm through physical contact, such as a protective arm across the shoulder, if it appears 
welcome. Some children may dislike or have a negative association with being touched. If you are 
unsure, ask them if you may touch them. 
National Child Traumatic Stress Network    National Center for PTSD 
38
Core Action 3: Stabilization


Distract the child from the situation by asking questions about his/her favorite story, hobby, sport, or song. 
Keep the circumstances in mind so that you do not inadvertently trigger greater anxiety by asking about 
a topic that may be related to existing fears (such as asking, “What is your favorite bedtime story?” when 
the child is fearful for his/her caregiver’s safety).


Give age-appropriate information about what to expect, and always answer questions in an honest, 
developmentally appropriate way. 


Do not overwhelm children with too much information. Under stress, a child can only process so much 
information, and will likely change the subject or move to a different activity when feeling overwhelmed. 
Watch for and be respectful of the cues the child gives.


Reconnect children with their caregivers or staff who know them as soon as possible.
Putting PFA into Practice 
Upon arriving late at school, a high school student learned that his best friend had died the night before. 
The principal had been informed by the family early that morning, and news of the death had spread 
through the school. Staff were very concerned about the friend’s reactions once he learned of the death. 
One teacher, who felt he had established a positive relationship with the teen, offered to be with the 
principal when he broke the news. The teen immediately became extremely agitated, pacing the office, 
holding and shaking his head, shouting “No, no, no!” Sensing that the boy was near panic, the principal 
and the teacher spoke calmly and gently, guiding the boy to sit and take slow breaths. The teacher then 
stayed in the office with the teen, offering emotional support by his mere physical presence until the teen 
was ready to ask questions and speak about his friend.
Observation, physical presence, a soothing voice, and anxiety-reducing techniques (e.g., slow breathing) 
helped to stabilize the teen.
Use these talking points to help individuals understand their reactions: 
For adults, adolescents, and school-aged children


You may feel intense emotions coming and going like waves. (You may also feel emotionally knocked 
down or dragged under, just when you thought you were standing on firm ground.)


You may find that shocking experiences trigger strong—and often upsetting—self-protective “alarm” 
reactions in the body, such as an adrenaline surge, startling easily, or being on-guard.


Sometimes you may feel so anxious, upset, and out of control, you wonder if you’re going crazy. Remember 
that these are expectable and understandable reactions to a very upsetting and frightening event. 


Sometimes the best way to recover is to take a few moments to do activities that calm you (take a walk, 
breathe slowly, listen to music).


Calm yourself by keeping in mind the family members and friends who love you and support you.

Core Action 3: Stabilization
REMEMBER
Adolescents and young adults may have impulses to do something risky, just to feel better temporarily. 
They may not see the need to be cautious. Ask them to try talking to an adult they trust before acting 
impulsively. For example, you might say, “When something bad like this happens, it is really important 
to talk to adults that you trust. Is there anyone who helps you feel better? Maybe I can help you reach 
him or her.”
For young children 


After bad things happen, your body may have strong feelings that come and go like waves in the ocean. 
First you’re feeling sort of okay, but then you feel bad all over again. When you feel really bad, that’s a 
good time to talk to your mom and/or dad to help you calm down. Here at school, there are teachers or 
other adults you can talk to.


Did you know that lots of people need help at times like this? See all the people here with the vests on 
and all those guys out front with the yellow jackets? All these people—and many more—are working 
together to help keep you and the other children safe, and to help people feel better.


One trick to help you start to feel a little better is to do something. Just sitting here might be boring or 
make you feel even worse. Would you like to play with the other kids or would you like to draw? Do you 
know Mrs. Smith? She’s teaching some kids a breathing game to help them calm their bodies. Calming 
your body can help calm your mind, and that can help you start to feel better.
Assist Individuals with Extreme Agitation and Disorientation
If the person appears extremely agitated, has accelerated speech, seems out of touch with the surroundings, 
or is crying intensely, it may be helpful to:


Position yourself at eye level, so he/she becomes aware of you.


Ask the individual to listen to you and look at you.


Find out if he/she knows who he/she is, where he/she is, and what is happening.


Ask him/her to describe the surroundings and say where both of you are.
If these actions do not help, introduce a technique called “grounding,” by saying:
Child/Student
After a frightening experience, you can be very upset or angry or unable to 
stop thinking about what happened. I can help you feel less overwhelmed by 
teaching you about something called “grounding.” Grounding works by having 
you focus on the things you see and hear around you, instead of all the 
thoughts you’re having. Would you like to try it?
National Child Traumatic Stress Network    National Center for PTSD 
40
Core Action 3: Stabilization
If the person agrees, speak in a calm, quiet voice and lead him/her through the steps:


Sit in a comfortable position with your legs and arms uncrossed.


Breathe in and out slowly three times.


Look around you and name five non-distressing, simple objects that you can see. For example, you might 
say, “I see the floor, I see a shoe, I see a table, I see a chair, I see my friend.”


Breathe in and out slowly three times.


Next, name five non-distressing sounds you can hear. For example, you might say, “I hear a teacher 
talking, I hear myself breathing, I hear a door close, I hear kids playing, I hear a cell phone ringing.”


Breathe in and out slowly three times.


Next, name five non-distressing things you can feel. For example, you might say, “I can feel the pen in my 
hand, I can feel my toes inside my shoes, I can feel my back pressing against my chair, I can feel my feet 
on the floor, I can feel my lips pressed together.”


Breathe in and out slowly three times.
If the person selects distressing objects or sounds to name, interrupt him/her and suggest he/she pick items 
that are not upsetting.
You might have a younger student name the colors of objects that he/she sees around them. For example, 
you could say, “Next, name five colors that you can see from where you are sitting. Tell me something you see 
that is blue, now something that’s yellow, now something green.”
Stabilize Students in Group Settings
While working with a group of students, monitor how the students are responding to the discussion. If you 
see that students are getting distressed, stabilize the situation by conducting a neutral group activity. These 
activities can be drawing/coloring, a writing exercise, a breathing exercise, making a collage, or working 
together on a mural. If a student is still having problems calming down, you or another PFA-S provider should 
work with him/her in private. 
Putting PFA into Practice 
After the sudden, violent death of a favorite teacher, the fourth grade class came together to talk about 
him and the upsetting news. As the level of anxiety increased among the students, the adult stopped the 
discussion and guided the students in slow breathing, stretching out their arms, and then shaking the 
tension out of their hands. Once relaxed, the group resumed their discussion.
Taking a break in the discussion and doing a calming activity can quickly stabilize a situation.

Goal
To identify immediate needs and concerns, gather additional information, and tailor 
Psychological First Aid for Schools interventions to meet these needs
In most emergencies, you will have limited time to gather information, and you will have to adjust to 
individuals’ needs and priorities. Therefore, you will need to be flexible in adapting PFA-S interventions. 
Although a formal assessment is not appropriate, gather enough information so that you can tailor 
interventions quickly to these needs and concerns. 
National Child Traumatic Stress Network    National Center for PTSD 
42
Core Action 4: Information Gathering: Needs and Current Concerns
Gather Information Directly with These Questions:
1.	 How are you doing now? What are your immediate needs and concerns?
Students and staff will experience the emergency differently. By asking these questions, you will find 
out what concerns are most pressing. Also, ask if they have any immediate safety issues, medical or 
psychiatric concerns, or problems attending to basic needs. Highlight that you are willing to discuss 
whatever they wish—a big problem or even something they think is trivial. Some students and staff may 
not talk because they feel others are in greater need of your services. Assure them that you and your 
team have time for everyone. 
2.  What happened to you during the event? How were you affected?
You will want to find out how the person was impacted by the event. You might ask:


Where were you during the emergency?


Did you feel threatened? Did you get hurt/injured?


Do you still feel threatened?


What problems do you have now? Do you have any continuing or ongoing problems?


Did a loved one die or suffer severe injury?


Have you lost contact with, or are you separated from, a loved one?


Did you (or your family) lose any personal property?


Did your pet die or get hurt?
Provider Alert
In clarifying emergency-related experiences, avoid asking for in-depth descriptions, as this may provoke 
additional distress. Follow the individual’s lead in discussing what happened. Do not press him/her to 
disclose the details of a trauma or loss. If a person is anxious to talk about an experience, respectfully say 
that you can best help now by getting some basic information so that you can help with his/her current 
needs, and that you will give him/her referrals to talk with a school counselor or professional about his/her 
experiences. Remind the person that immediately after an emergency it is difficult to fully protect his/her 
privacy, and that the situation may not permit you to give him/her enough time to fully assist with his/her 
experiences.
Psychological First Aid for Schools Field Operations Guide
43
Core Action 4: Information Gathering: Needs and Current Concerns
3.  How has the event impacted you, your family, and your friends?
When asking this question, use the names of the individuals that the person has already mentioned. 
When working with middle or high school students, ask how their classmates and friends are doing. Note 
whether students are limiting their interactions with others, delaying important developmental activities 
(birthday, prom, getting a driver’s license), or increasing at-risk behaviors (drinking, using drugs, reckless 
driving, self-injurious behaviors). Also, explore students’ ability to do schoolwork, their sleep habits, and 
recent moods.
4.  When you look ahead, do you have any concerns? Is there anything 
bothering you about your future?
These questions allow you to identify any academic concerns, worries about relationships, changes in 
parental behavior, and developmental issues.
5.  Is there anything else you would like to share?
You can use the form Student/Staff Current Needs (Appendix C) to document the information you have 
gathered. Additionally, use the Psychological First Aid Provider Worksheet (Appendix C) to document the 
services you have provided. 
Gather Information Indirectly
Use other ways to gather information in addition to direct interviewing. For example, encourage the use of 
the referral procedures in place for teachers and staff so that if they see changes in a student’s behavior 
they can contact you or another PFA-S provider to follow up. As noted previously, you can work with school 
administration to find out what happened during the event. The more you know about what occurred, the 
better you will be able to identify individuals who need to be checked on. 
The PFA-Team Leader can also monitor daily attendance, and disciplinary and nursing logs to identify 
students at risk. Remember: some students and staff will ask for help, but most will not. Some may complain 
of physical symptoms (e.g., headaches, stomachaches, rapid heart beat) and frequently visit the nurse. Be 
watchful, so you can identify and help those individuals affected by the emergency. 
Gather Information to Guide Your Intervention Choices
As PFA-S is a modular and flexible approach, the information you obtain will guide the intervention strategies 
you choose to use. The table Areas of Concern and PFA Intervention on the following pages indicates the 
strategies to use based on different pressing needs or concerns reported. Much of the information that will be 
gathered is from conversation and what the individual reports as current concerns. Do not use the table as a 
checklist and ask each of these questions. Also keep in mind your role. If an individual brings up concerns you 
are not trained to assist in, get help from the PFA-S Team Leader or a mental health professional.

Goal
To offer practical help to students and staff to address their immediate needs and 
concerns
National Child Traumatic Stress Network    National Center for PTSD

Core Action 5: Practical Assistance
Individuals likely to have more favorable outcomes after emergencies are those who have one or more of the 
following characteristics:


Optimism (a belief that things will turn out as well as can be expected) 


Confidence that life is predictable 


Belief that they can achieve the goals they set (self-efficacy)


Belief that outside sources will act benevolently on one’s behalf (e.g., that the community is willing to 
help)


Positive self-talk or beliefs (e.g., “I have gotten through some tough situations in the past and I can get 
through this too”)


Knowledge that they will have the resources they need (such as support from others, money for essential 
expenses, the opportunity to receive tutoring services)
Providing students, staff, and their families with needed resources can empower them, help them have hope, 
and restore their dignity. Therefore, assisting individuals with current or anticipated problems is a central 
component of PFA-S. 
Offer Practical Assistance to School Personnel
After emergencies, staff members are often asked by students and their families about resources available at 
the school and in the community to address post-event adversities. Keep staff informed about the resources or 
services that are currently available and where they can connect families to organizations or individuals who are 
coordinating such activities. This information should include ways to help address students’ academic needs 
and connect them with resources to facilitate their learning (identify whether transfer students have an IEP in 
place, availability of tutoring services, and/or where they can obtain school supply donations). Work with teachers 
around what homework strategies will help students with attention and concentration problems. Some events may 
cause students additional stress. For example, athletes who have to relocate to a new school may be concerned 
about being able join the team at the new school, or that a temporary decline in grades may impact their potential 
for acceptance at colleges. Work with the appropriate school staff member to address these types of concerns. 
To facilitate the school’s recovery, school staff can encourage students to organize or participate in various 
recovery activities, including donation drives, clean-up days, or events that promote wellness or civic 
responsibility. Teachers can establish class goals and can display the class’s progress as they move forward. 
Staff can help students’ problem-solve how they can share with others in the school community or how they 
can lend a helping hand.
Staff may have their own needs, and they may welcome your assistance. For example, they may have lost 
their own homes in a disaster and struggle with the rebuilding process themselves. Helping staff problem-
solve together on how to support their school community and each other can improve their recovery process.
Throughout any contact, do all you can to help students and staff members identify immediate needs, 
set priorities, and choose initial steps to address the problems they face. Even under conditions of stress 
Psychological First Aid for Schools Field Operations Guide
49
Core Action 5: Practical Assistance
and adversity, helping individuals set achievable goals may reverse their immediate feelings of failure and 
inability to cope, give them repeated successes, and help them reestablish the sense of control necessary for 
recovery.
Offer Practical Assistance to Students and Staff
Students, staff, and family members benefit from clarifying their needs and concerns, developing a plan 
to address them, and acting on the plan. Their ability to clarify what they want, think through alternatives, 
select the best option, and follow through develops gradually. For example, many school-age students can 
participate in problem solving, but they will require the assistance of adults to follow through with their plans. 
When appropriate, share the plans you have developed with parents/caregivers or involve parents/caregivers 
in making the plans, so that they can help the child or adolescent complete them. 
Follow these four steps when offering practical assistance:
Step 1:  Identify the Most Immediate Needs
If the student, staff member, or family member has identified several needs or current concerns, focus on them one 
at a time. For some needs, there will be immediate solutions (e.g., getting school books, phoning a family member 
to reassure him/her that the student or staff member is okay). Others (locating a lost loved one, obtaining services 
due to a newly acquired disability/injury, securing insurance for lost property, acquiring childcare for after-school 
hours) will not be solved quickly, and may be impossible to solve within the school setting. Collaborate with the 
individual to help him/her select the issues that require immediate help. For example, you might say: 
Adult
I understand from what you’re telling me, Mrs. Williams, that your main goal 
right now is to rebuild your house so that your kids can stay in the same 
school. Let’s make a plan for what you have to do next.
Adolescent/ Child
It sounds as if you are really worried about four different things: (1) what happened 
to your house, (2) when your dad is coming for you, (3) whether you will be able to 
return to your classroom, and (4) what will happen next. All of these are important, 
but let’s decide which is most important right now, and then make a plan.
Step 2:  Clarify the Need
Talk with the individual to specify the primary problem. Once you have helped him/her clarify the problem, you 
will be able to identify the next practical step to address it. You might say:
Teacher/ School 
Personnel
I understand that your first concern is about several students whose parents 
can’t be contacted. Let’s work on a plan to address that problem.
Adolescent/ Child
It sounds as if you are worried about several things. Right now let’s focus on 
finding out where your sister is.
National Child Traumatic Stress Network    National Center for PTSD

Core Action 5: Practical Assistance
Teacher/ School 
Personnel
I understand that your biggest worry right now is what to tell your students 
about the situation. Let’s talk about what you might say.
Adolescent/ Child
You seem to be very worried about what is going to happen next. Let’s talk 
about what you can expect for the rest of the day.
Step 3:  Discuss an Action Plan
Discuss what can be done to address the individual’s needs or concerns. He/she may have ideas, or 
you can offer a suggestion. If you know ahead of time what services are available, you can help obtain 
food, clothing, shelter, tutoring, mental health, or childcare services, financial assistance, help to locate 
missing family members or friends, and volunteer opportunities for those who want to help in the relief 
efforts. Give school personnel realistic expectations about resources and support, qualification criteria, and 
application procedures. The more you understand the community’s and school system’s plan for dealing with 
emergencies, the more you will be a reliable resource for what can be expected.
Step 4: Act to Address the Need
Help the individual to take action. For example, help him/her set an appointment for a needed service, or 
assist him/her in completing paperwork. Within the school setting, you may be able to address the need 
yourself, but you may also help staff to decide on the actions to address that need. For example, encourage 
community agencies to present and have available the paperwork at a parent’s meeting, so that parents have 
a better understanding of available services and they can sign up for more than one program or service at a 
time.
Putting PFA into Practice 
Over the weekend, a family who had two students enrolled in the school lost everything in a residential 
fire. The vice principal contacted the mother, who was worried about how she could acquire clothing and 
school supplies so that her children could return to the school. The vice principal told her that the PTA 
and the school community wanted to help. The mother gave permission, a fund was set up in the family’s 
name, and the students organized a bake sale to raise money.
Assisting others after an emergency can be rewarding for the entire school community.

Connection with Social Supports
Illustration by Dr. Bob Seaver
Goal
To help establish brief or ongoing contacts with primary support persons or other 
sources of support, including family, friends, teachers, and school and/or community 
resources 
Social support is an important component of emotional well-being and recovery following emergencies. 
Students and staff members who are well connected with others are more likely to engage in supportive 
activities (both receiving and giving support) that assist with recovery. 
National Child Traumatic Stress Network    National Center for PTSD 
52
Core Action 6: Connection with Social Supports
Provide Basic Information about Social Supports 
Social support can come in many forms:
•	 Emotional support: a listening ear, understanding, love, acceptance
•	 Social connection: feeling as if you fit in and have things in common with other people; having people 
with whom you can talk and do activities 
•	 Feeling needed: feeling that you are important to others, that you are valued, useful, and productive, 
and that people appreciate you
•	 Reassurance of self-worth: people who help you feel confident in yourself and your abilities, who 
believe that you can handle the challenges you face, and who help you remember the effective things 
you have done in past difficult situations
•	 Reliable support: having people reassure you that they will be there for you if you need them and that 
you can rely on them for help
•	 Advice and information: having people show you how to do something, give you information that 
you need, or offer good advice, and help you understand that your reactions to the event are common; 
having people who are good role models, from whom you can learn how to cope with what is happening 
in positive ways
•	 Physical assistance: having people to help you do things, such as cleaning up the classroom, helping 
you with paperwork, or gathering class assignments for you
•	 Material assistance: having people who can get you access to food, clothing, shelter, medicine, 
textbooks, school supplies, or money
Assist students and their families, as well as staff members, to develop and maintain their social connections 
as soon as possible. Critical to recovery, social connectedness has these benefits:


Opportunities for sharing knowledge


Opportunities for a range of social support activities, including:
–
–
Practical problem-solving
–
–
Emotional understanding and acceptance 
–
–
Sharing of experiences and concerns
–
–
Normalization of reactions
–
–
Teaching each other about coping
Enhance Access to Primary Support Persons 
(Family and Significant Others)
Most individuals will immediately want to contact those with whom they have a primary relationship (parents, 
other family members, close friends, teachers, spouses or intimate partners, neighbors, and clergy). Take 
practical steps to assist students and school staff to reach these individuals (in person, by phone, by e-mail, 
through Internet databases/social media sites). 
Psychological First Aid for Schools Field Operations Guide
53
Core Action 6: Connection with Social Supports
They may want to contact other sources of social support, such as coaches, peers, co-workers, or club 
members (after-school clubs or sports teams). For most students and staff, the school itself functions as a 
setting of primary support. Reinforcing the connectedness to the school “family” will be helpful. Some students 
and staff may also be worried about family members in neighboring schools. Provide information about what 
is known about the nearby schools and clarify any misinformation about the safety of others. 
Enhance the School Community
One of the objectives of PFA-S is to stabilize the school community and to foster an environment for learning. 
To accomplish this goal:


Promote a sense of tolerance by helping students and staff members understand that everyone is on their 
own recovery path. Some will need longer, while others may not have been affected. Acceptance of this 
difference and giving each other support can foster a healthy recovery environment. 


Highlight the importance of mutual aid among the students and staff. Brainstorm ways that groups can 
work together to address mutual problems.


Encourage students to watch out for each other. If they see a change in a peer’s behavior or mood, they 
should notify a parent, school counselor, or other trusted adult. 


Create a plan for integrating new students who may have temporarily or permanently transferred to the 
school. Attempt to integrate these students into the school culture, and orient them to the school rules/
procedures as quickly as possible. Avoid singling these students out in a way that alienates them from 
the rest of the student body. For example, transfer students who have been given increased personal 
attention and received new backpacks or supplies from staff might be resented by other members of the 
student body, making it more difficult for new students to find friends or feel included. 


If a school structure has been destroyed and students have been assigned to new locations, strategize 
ways to reconnect old classmates if possible. Work with the school administration or community agencies 
to create events that will bring together students from the same community (e.g., charity runs, food 
drives). A website can also be set up so that students can communicate with each other. If siblings are 
separated, encourage “bring your sibling to school day,” so that they can see the classrooms and the new 
building. 


Facilitate social support activities by encouraging staff and teachers to increase the number of group 
activities and collaborative assignments. 


Alert students and staff to upcoming community events and school-sponsored meetings. Give details 
about events, and add precautions if you are concerned that some students may not be ready for some 
events (e.g., memorials).


Consider what developmental milestones may have interrupted for students and staff (e.g., graduation, 
retirement, first dance) and help them find ways to address this disruption. For example, they may have to 
postpone or relocate the celebration or they may have to adjust their expectations.
National Child Traumatic Stress Network    National Center for PTSD 
54
Core Action 6: Connection with Social Supports
Some individuals may need assistance in adjusting to changes in their relationships. For example, parents may 
monitor their children more after an emergency, which may be especially difficult for adolescents to handle. 
You may have to help students understand that their parents were also affected by the situation and that these 
changes are typically temporary. Other changes may be due to some individuals’ being more directly impacted 
by the event, how they are coping (seeking help vs. avoidance), and their involvement in the situation. Individuals 
who have visible injuries may have difficulty relating to their peers; they may become a reminder to others of what 
happened and lose important connections. Those who were considered “heroes” may gain immediate attention 
from the school community, and then struggle when those connections fade. If they were friends with an individual 
who is being blamed for the incident, they may be faced with alienation or bullying. As these changes occur, 
you may have to help facilitate communication between peer groups, or help individuals with seeking or giving 
support. Peer-to-peer programs can also help facilitate a sense of belonging among students. 
Discuss Support-Seeking and Giving
If students or staff members are reluctant to seek support, there may be many reasons, including:


Not knowing what they need (and perhaps feeling that they should know)


Feeling embarrassed or weak because they need help


Feeling guilty about receiving help when others are in greater need


Not knowing where to turn for help


Not knowing how to ask for help


Worrying that they will be a burden or depress others


Thinking that since they’ve been helped in the past, they shouldn’t ask again


Fearing that they will get so upset that they will lose control


Doubting that support will be available or helpful


Thinking, “No one can understand what I’m going through”


Having tried to get help in the past and finding that help was not there (feeling let down or betrayed)


Fearing that the people they ask will be angry or make them feel guilty for needing help
In helping students and staff to appreciate the value of social support and engaging with others, you can also 
help them to:


Think about the type of support that would be most helpful


Think about whom they might approach for that type of support


Choose the right time and place to approach the person


Talk to the support person and explain how he/she can be of help


Thank the support person afterwards for his/her time and help
Psychological First Aid for Schools Field Operations Guide
55
Core Action 6: Connection with Social Supports
Let people know that, following a stressful, frightening event, some people choose not to talk about their 
experiences, and that spending time (sitting, walking, hanging out, playing a game) with people can allow one 
to feel close without talking. For example, your message might be: 
Adult/Caregiver
When you’re able to leave school, you may not want to talk, but just be with 
the people you feel close to. At some point, you may find it helpful to talk 
about what you have been through. You can decide what to talk about and 
when. You don’t have to talk about everything that occurred, just what you 
choose to share with the other person.
Adolescent/Child
When something really upsetting like this happens, it’s okay not to talk if you 
don’t want to. Hanging out with people you are close to without saying a word 
can be a good thing to do. But if you want or need something, be sure to 
reach out to someone you trust.
For those who would like to provide support to others, you can help them to: 


Discover ways that they can help others (tutor students who missed school, organize fundraisers, 
disseminate donations, ask a friend if he/she wants to talk)


Identify a person or persons to help


Find an uninterrupted time and place to talk or to help


Show interest, attention, and care


Offer to talk or spend time together as often as needed
Let them know that, instead of discussing the event, it is better to provide practical assistance and help to 
problem-solve current needs and concerns.
Model Support
As a provider, you can model positive supportive responses, such as:
Reflective comments:
“From what you’re saying, I can see how you would be . . .”  
“It sounds as if you’re saying . . .”  
“It seems that you are . . .”  
Clarifying comments:
“Tell me if I’m wrong, but it sounds as if you . . .”  
“Am I right when I say that you . . .”  
National Child Traumatic Stress Network    National Center for PTSD

Core Action 6: Connection with Social Supports
Supportive 
comments:
“No wonder you feel . . .”  
“It sounds really hard . . .”  
“It sounds as if you’re being hard on yourself.”
“It is such a tough thing to go through something like this.”
“I’m really sorry this is such a tough time for you.”
“We can talk more tomorrow if you’d like.”
Empowering 
comments and 
questions:
“What have you done in the past to help yourself feel better when things got 
difficult?”
“What do you think would help you to feel better?”
“I have an information sheet with some ideas about how to deal with difficult 
situations. Maybe there’s an idea or two here that might be helpful for you.”
“People can be very different in what helps them to feel better. When things 
get difficult for me, it has helped me to . . . Do you think something like that 
would work for you?”
If appropriate, distribute the handouts Connecting with Others: Seeking Social Support and Connecting 
with Others: Giving Social Support provided in Appendix C.
Putting PFA into Practice 
Following a school shooting, the track team struggled with how to support one another.
The team had always been close. Two of its members had been shot and could no longer compete with 
the team. A PFA provider, along with the coach, met with the entire team to discuss ways they could 
support each other during this difficult time. The injured students discussed how they wanted to remain 
part of the team, so the group problem-solved that the students would become managers of the team 
and have specific roles in the meets. The group agreed to check in again after the first meet to see how 
everyone was doing.
Creating open communication and an understanding of each other’s recovery can create problem-
solving strategies that can foster a group’s recovery.

Goal
To provide information about stress reactions and coping to reduce distress and

Emergencies can be disorienting, confusing, and overwhelming, putting students and staff members at risk 
for feeling incompetent to handle problems that they face. Feeling confident that one can cope with trauma-
related stress and adversity is beneficial to recovery.
National Child Traumatic Stress Network    National Center for PTSD 
58
Core Action 7: Information on Coping
Giving students, staff, and their families certain information can help them manage their stress reactions and



What is currently known about the unfolding event


What is being done to assist them


What, where, and when services are available


What post-disaster reactions to expect and how to manage them


What they can do to assist with self-care, family care, and adaptive coping
Provide Basic Information about Stress Reactions
Briefly discuss the stress reactions that people commonly experience after a crisis. You may: 


Highlight that they may be frightened or alarmed by their own response, and may view their reactions in 
negative ways (e.g., thinking, “There’s something wrong with me” or “I’m weak”). You can reduce their 
worry about their own responses by explaining that their reactions are understandable and expectable.


Avoid pathologizing stress reactions; do not use terms like “symptoms” or “disorder.” 


Make sure you note that there is a range of possible reactions from negative to positive, including 
a greater appreciation of life, family, and friends, or a strengthening of spiritual beliefs and social 
connections, so as not to give people the suggestion that they will only be negatively affected by events.


Indicate that if their stress reactions continue to interfere with their ability to function adequately for more 
than a month, they should seek psychological services or student support staff to help restore their pre-
event level of functioning. (Remember that you may have to refer earlier if the individual is having major 
difficulty with sleep, unable to care for oneself, or shows signs of safety concerns.)
Provider Alert
While it may be helpful to describe stress reactions and to note that intense reactions are common but 
often diminish over time, avoid providing “blanket” reassurance that stress reactions will disappear. This 
may set up unrealistic expectations about the time it takes to recover.
Putting PFA into Practice 
PFA providers were called to a school after the death of a preschool student. Parents were concerned about how 
to explain death to children who had not previously experienced a death. Providers gave parents and teachers 
information about young children’s limited understanding of death and the need to explain death in sensitive, but 
concrete, terms. Providers also gave information about common grief reactions and the need to actively listen to 
young children’s feelings. Some of the parents were reluctant to talk to their child about death, stating that their 
child did not need to know and would not understand. However, when several parents utilized the information 
they were provided and talked with their children, they were surprised and relieved to find their children able to 
talk about the death, to express sadness for the loss, and to share positive memories of their friend. 
Providing psychoeducation to parents can help them be more responsive to their children.

Core Action 7: Information on Coping
Common Psychological Reactions to Traumatic 
Experiences and Losses
Below is basic information about posttraumatic stress and other reactions that you can discuss with students 
and staff as issues arise.
Posttraumatic stress reactions:
Intrusive Reactions are ways in which the traumatic experience comes back to mind. These reactions 
include distressing thoughts or mental images of the event (e.g., visualizing what one saw) or dreams about 
what happened. In children, bad dreams may not be specifically about the trauma. Intrusive reactions also 
include upsetting emotional or physical reactions to reminders of the experience. Some people may feel 
and act as if one of their worst experiences is happening all over again. These reactions can interfere with 
individuals’ attention, concentration, and overall functioning at school.
Avoidance and Withdrawal Reactions are ways people use to keep away from, or protect against, intrusive 
reactions. They may try to avoid talking, thinking, and having feelings about the emergency, and avoid 
reminders of the event, including places and people. They may restrict or numb their emotions to protect 
themselves against distress. Their feelings of detachment and estrangement from others may lead to social 
withdrawal. They may lose interest in formerly pleasurable activities. Those experiencing these reactions may 
miss school more frequently, limit their participation in school activities, or change their peer group.
Physical Arousal Reactions are bodily responses to danger that occur when the danger is no longer 
present. People may react by constantly being “on the lookout” for danger, by startling easily or being jumpy, 
by being irritable or having outbursts of anger, having difficulty falling or staying asleep, and having problems 
concentrating or paying attention. Those struggling with these reactions can result in problems with school or 
work functioning, completing chores or homework, peers relationships, and overall health.
Other kinds of reactions: 
Grief Reactions will be prevalent among those who survived the event but have suffered losses, such as the 
death of loved ones, or loss of their home, possessions, pets, school, or community. Loss may lead to feelings 
of sadness and anger, guilt or regret over the death, missing or longing for the deceased, and dreams of seeing 
the person again. More information on grief reactions can be found in the section on Safety and Comfort. 
Traumatic Grief Reactions occur when children and adults have suffered the traumatic death of a loved one. 
Some survivors may stay focused on the circumstances of the death, including being preoccupied with how the 
death could have been prevented, what the loved one’s last moments were like, and who was at fault. These 
reactions may interfere with grieving, making it more difficult for survivors to adjust to the death over time. More 
information on traumatic grief reactions and how to respond can be found in the section on Safety and Comfort.
Depression is associated with prolonged grief reactions, and is strongly related to the accumulation of post-
event adversities. Reactions include persistent depressed or irritable mood, loss of appetite, sleep disturbance, 
greatly diminished interest or pleasure in life activities, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or 
guilt, feelings of hopelessness, and sometimes thoughts about suicide.

Physical Reactions are commonly experienced, even in the absence of any underlying physical injury or 
illness. These reactions include headaches, dizziness, stomachaches, muscle aches, rapid heart beating, 
tightness in the chest, hyperventilation, loss of appetite, and bowel problems. 
Reminders and hardships:
Trauma Reminders can be sights, sounds, places, smells, specific people, time of day, situations, or even 
feelings such as being afraid or anxious. Trauma reminders are related to the specific type of event—such as 
a hurricane, shooting, flood, tornado, or fire—and specific circumcumstances can evoke upsetting thoughts 
and feelings about what happened. Examples include hearing the sound of wind, rain, helicopters, screaming 
or shouting, and seeing individuals who were present at the event. Students reacting to such reminders can 
cause them to be distracted, miss teacher instruction, engage in risky behaviors, and may result in a decline 
in academic performance.
Loss Reminders can also be sights, sounds, places, smells, specific people, time of day, situations, or 
feelings. Examples include seeing a picture of a lost loved one or seeing their belongings, such as their 
locker or desk. Loss reminders bring to mind the absence of the loved one. Missing the deceased can evoke 
strong feelings of sadness, anxiety, uncertainty about life without him/her, anger, loneliness, abandonment, or 
hopelessness. Loss reminders can lead students to miss school or other activities to avoid experiencing these 
reminders.
Change Reminders can be people, places, things, activities, or hardships that remind people of how their 
lives have changed as the result of an emergency. Change reminders can be something as simple as waking 
up in a different bed in the morning, going to a different school, or being in a refurbished place. Even nice 
things can remind people of how life has changed and make them miss what they had before.
Hardships often follow in the wake of disaster and can make it more difficult to recover. Hardships place 
additional strains on survivors and can contribute to feelings of anxiety, depression, irritability, uncertainty, and 
mental and physical exhaustion. Hardships can be loss of home or possessions, lack of money, shortages 
of food or water, separations from friends and family, school closures, medical or physical health problems, 
the process of obtaining compensation for losses, moving to a new area, and lack of fun activities. For these 
types of emergencies, the response phase may be longer and trauma/grief specific services will be needed to 
facilitate the school recovery.

Talking with Students about Physical and 
Emotional Reactions 
Students may show a wide range of responses in the aftermath of an emergency. Some students will seem to 
bounce back fairly quickly, while others will take more time to recover. Keep in mind that children of the same 
age, exposed to the same event, may show very different reactions. Children also vary in their capacity to see 
connections between events and emotions. Many will benefit from a basic explanation of how trauma-related 
experiences produce upsetting emotions and physical sensations. Below are suggestions for working with 
students individually or within groups: 
Suggestions
Examples
Ask students to tell you about their physical 
sensations, instead of directly asking them to 
describe their emotions.
“How do you feel inside?”
“Do you feel something like butterflies in your 
stomach or tight all over?”
Students have a wide range of reactions after crises. If 
they have problems identifying their reactions, suggest 
one or two and then let them come up with other ways. 
pick one, rather than asking open-ended questions.
“Each one of you may have differently reactions 
to what happened. There is no right or wrong way. 
Some students may feel sad, others may feel knots 
in your stomach. What are other reactions?”
Draw (or ask the student to draw) an outline of a 
person, and use this to help the student talk about 
his/her physical sensations.
[Point to stomach] “How does it feel here?”
The following script provides a basic explanation that helps children to talk about their reactions: 
Sample Script:
Helping 
Students Talk 
about Emotions
When something really bad happens, kids may feel funny, strange, or 
uncomfortable. Maybe your heart is beating really fast, or your hands feel sweaty, 
or your stomach hurts, or your legs or arms feel weak or shaky. Other times kids 
just feel funny inside their heads, almost as if they cannot press stop on the DVR 
and they keep watching the bad thing happen over and over again in their mind. 
Sometimes your body keeps having these feelings for a while even after the bad 
thing is over and you are safe. These feelings are your body’s way of telling you 
again how bad the event was. 
There is a wide range of reactions that you may be feeling. Do you have any of 
these feelings now, or other ones that I didn’t talk about? Can you tell me where 
you feel them, and what they feel like? 
Sometimes these strange or uncomfortable feelings come up when kids see, hear, 
or smell things that remind them of the bad thing that happened, like strong winds, 
glass breaking, or the smell of smoke. It can be very scary for kids to have these 
feelings in their bodies, especially if they don’t know why they are happening or 
what to do about them. If you like, I can tell you some ways to help you cope better.

Providing Basic Information on Coping 
Discuss a variety of ways to cope effectively with post-event reactions and adversity. Adaptive coping 
actions help to reduce anxiety, lessen other distressing reactions, improve the situation, or help people get 
through bad times. Maladaptive coping actions tend to be ineffective in addressing problems.
Adaptive Coping Actions
Maladaptive Coping Actions
✔ Talking to someone (friend, teacher, support 
group, counselor)
✘ Watching too much TV or playing computer 
games too long
✔ Getting needed information
✘ Withdrawing from activities
✔ Getting adequate rest, nutrition, exercise
✘ Withdrawing from family or friends
✔ Engaging in positive, distracting activities (sports, 
hobbies, reading)
✘ Working too many hours or overly participating in 
activities to avoid reminders or feelings
✔ Trying your best to maintain a normal schedule 
✘ Getting violently angry
✔ Telling yourself that it is natural to be upset for 
some period of time; using calming self-talk
✘ Blaming yourself or others excessively
✔ Taking breaks; using relaxation methods
✘ Overeating or not eating enough
✔ Keeping a journal
✘ Using alcohol or drugs to cope
✔ Focusing on something practical that you can do 
right now to manage the situation better
✘ Doing risky or dangerous things
✔ Using coping methods that have been successful 
in the past
✘ Not taking care of yourself (too little sleep, poor 
diet, no exercise)
The aim of discussing positive and negative forms of coping is to:


Help students and staff consider different coping options 


Identify and acknowledge their personal coping strengths


Guide students and staff to examine the negative consequences of maladaptive coping actions


Encourage students to make conscious, goal-oriented choices 


Enhance a sense of personal control over their coping choices
Activity for Students
To help students identify positive and negative forms of coping, write down on slips of paper methods 
that students are currently using to cope. Then talk with them about adaptive and maladaptive coping 
strategies. Have the students sort the pieces of paper into two piles, one for each category, and then 
discuss ways they can increase their adaptive coping strategies. For younger children, play a memory 
game in which each coping strategy is written on two pieces of paper. Place the blank side of each paper 
face up, and have the children find matching pairs. Once a child finds a pair, discuss whether this is a 
good or bad strategy to help him/her feel better.

Relaxation Exercises 
Breathing exercises help reduce feelings of arousal and physical tension and, if practiced regularly, can 
improve sleep, eating, and functioning. You can teach simple breathing exercises quickly, particularly when 
people are calm and can pay attention. Give out the handout Tips for Relaxation (Appendix C) to reinforce 
the use and practice of these techniques. To teach a breathing exercise, you might say:
School Staff/ 
Adolescents
1.	 Sit in a comfortable position with your arms and legs uncrossed.
2.	 Inhale slowly through your nose or mouth (one-thousand one, one-
thousand two, one-thousand three), and fill your lungs. 
3.	 Silently and gently say to yourself, “I’m filling my body with calm.” 
4.	 Exhale slowly through your mouth (one-thousand one, one-thousand two, 
one-thousand three), and comfortably empty your lungs.
5.	 Silently and gently say to yourself, “I’m letting the tension drain away.” 
6.	 Repeat five times slowly.
Children
Let’s practice a different way of breathing that can help calm our bodies. 
1.	 I want each of you to think about your favorite color. Okay, we are going 
to breathe in through our noses or mouths. When we breathe in, we are 
going to think about our favorite color and the beautiful things that you 
connect with that color.
2.	 Next, we will breathe out slowly through our mouths. When we breathe 
out, we are going to breathe out the gray and the uncomfortable feelings 
that have been building up. Let out the air, slowly and quietly.
3.	 Let’s try it together. Breathe in really slowly and inhale thinking about your 
favorite color and the beautiful things connected to this color while I count 
to three. One…two…three. Good job. Now, while I count again, slowly 
let the air out while thinking about the color gray and all the unpleasant 
feelings. One…two…three. Great job. Let’s try it again together. 
[Remember to praise children for their efforts.]
If you find that a person has previously learned a relaxation technique, support him/her in doing what he/she 
has already learned rather than teaching new skills.
Relaxation Exercises in Groups
When teaching these skills in a group setting, have students seat themselves throughout the room in 
order to have more personal space. Some students may feel more comfortable closing their eyes, while 
others will not. Position yourself in the room in such a way that you can supervise the students during the 
exercise without having to walk too close to them. Students may find it disconcerting to have someone 
pass close by during relaxation.

Helping with Difficulties 
Concentrating and Learning
In the aftermath of emergencies, students and staff members may have difficulties concentrating on school 
tasks, focusing on work, and learning. They may have trouble thinking about anything other than what 
happened, how life is different, and what may be ahead. This may make it difficult for them to focus on what 
is required in school, and add to their distress. Find out if this is happening, and help students and staff 
members to find ways to focus and get back on track with schoolwork/teaching and other necessary tasks.
Things to Ask:


What are you worried about? How much are you thinking about it? For example, have you had trouble 
sleeping? Are you thinking a lot about what happened?


What would be a different way to give yourself time to think about what happened and what it means to 
you, so that it would be less likely to interfere with what you have to do right now?


What are some ways that you can stay focused and achieve what you need to do now?
Other Things to Consider:


Help the person focus on needed activities by encouraging him/her to set aside times for talking with 
others or for thinking about his/her concerns. Make sure the person doesn’t plan to think about his/her 
concerns at bedtime. 


Encourage the person to allow more time to complete school-related tasks, including taking more breaks 
and asking for help from others.


Work with teachers and parents to modify classroom and homework structures for students with particular 
difficulty concentrating, by reducing distractions, breaking schoolwork into more achievable chunks, and 
giving more frequent assistance and feedback on the student’s performance. 


Remind the person that he/she will feel better in the long run by staying on track with what is in front of 
him/her now.


Provide referral for additional services for individuals who have continued sleep difficulties, are overly 
preoccupied with thinking about what happened, and worried about the future.

Helping with Feelings of Anger and Frustration
Discussion Points about Anger


Many students and staff members will struggle with feelings of anger after crises. They may see the event 
as unfair to themselves, their families, and the community.


Having an anger problem before the event can make it more challenging to deal with anger afterwards.


It is common to feel angry, but angry actions or unsafe behaviors can cause problems with family or friends.


Holding on to the anger can hurt survivors or leave them feeling “stuck” in that bad moment. Coping with 
and letting go of anger, or directing energy toward positive activities, can help them move forward.


Controlling anger is a great way to stay in charge. The calmer 
you are, the more you have the upper hand. If a student and/
or staff member cannot control his/her anger, then others will 
have to step in to control them. Teens, in particular, seldom 
like the feeling of someone else taking control.
Ways to Help Individuals Cope with Anger
1.	 Establish a connection. Take time to get to know the person 
and to gain some trust. Those who act out in angry ways may 
actually feel quite scared and vulnerable. 
2.	 Discuss the warning signs of anger. Suggest that they can become more aware of early warning signs 
of anger by watching for clenched fists, biting one’s lip, yelling, and/or throwing objects. 
3.	 Develop a plan. Brainstorm several ways to cope with anger. Help 
students and staff plan responses to fit different challenging situations. 
4.	 Model and role-play. Demonstrate using the plan in a challenging 
situation. First, you should play (model) the role of the angry individual 
applying his/her plan. Then, have the person practice the anger coping 
plan. Do this a couple of times, until he/she feels comfortable with 
the plan. If you are working in a group, pick a member who appears 
comfortable speaking in front of others to try it.
5.	 Reinforce. Praise the individual’s efforts when you see them using 
their anger coping plan. Sometimes students find it helpful to share 
their plan with others (parents, for example) who can support the 
student’s coping. 
6.	 Monitor and evaluate. If possible, try out the plan an agreed-upon 
number of times; later, review how well it worked or did not work. 
Change the plan as needed. 
Ways to Cope
•	 Take a “time out”
•	 Talk to a friend
•	 Exercise
•	 Write about it
•	 Draw a picture
•	 Read a book
•	 Listen to music
•	 Pray/meditate
•	 Look at it from 
another’s viewpoint
•	 Problem-solve
Provider Alert
Working with angry individuals can 
make professionals feel uncomfortable. 
Remain calm yourself. Keep safety in 
mind, but remind yourself that anger 
in these situations is common. If an 
individual appears out of control or 
becomes violent, contact security.

Helping with Guilt, Shame, and 
Other Difficult Emotions 
Students and staff may think about what caused the event, how they reacted, and what the future holds. They 
may blame themselves or others, adding to their distress. Listen for such negative beliefs, and help them to 
look at the situation in ways that are less upsetting. 
Things to Ask:


What would be a different way to look at the situation that would be less upsetting and more helpful? 
What’s another way of thinking about this?


What are some other ways people might look at the situation. Would this be more or less upsetting to 
you? What would you say to a good friend who was talking like this? Can you say the same things to 
yourself?
Developmental Alert
When working with younger children, use an activity. They often find it easier to focus on play objects 
such as dolls or puppets or to draw pictures related to their feelings. 
Remember that the purpose of the activity is to help children find a different way to view their situation, 
not merely to act out their feelings without resolution. Actively participate by labeling feelings, clarifying 
the thoughts of the characters, or joining in the play to model a different way of thinking about or 
responding to the situation. 
Other Things to Consider:


Explain that even if he/she feels at fault, that does not make it true. If he/she is receptive, offer some 
alternative ways of looking at the situation. 


Help to clarify misunderstandings, rumors, and distortions that exacerbate distress, unwarranted guilt, or 
shame. 


For children and adolescents who have difficulty labeling these thoughts, you can write out their negative 
thoughts on a piece of paper (“I did something wrong,” “I caused it to happen,” “I was misbehaving”). 
For a child still struggling with this, you may suggest some negative thoughts that other children have 
had and invite him/her to identify the ones that fit best. You can then discuss each one, clarify any 
misunderstandings, discuss helpful counter-thoughts, and write those down as well. 


Remind the person that he/she is not at fault, even if he/she has not expressed this concern directly.


In the event that the person is in some way responsible and is dealing with the resulting guilt, he/
she should be referred for ongoing counseling. These situations fall outside the scope of short-term 
interventions such as PFA-S.

Risk-Taking Behaviors
Following Traumatic Events 
Things to Keep in Mind: 


Some students and young adults increase their risk-taking behaviors 
and may have more accidents.


Their actions may be more unpredictable or impulsive.


Trauma increases adults’ and students’ risk for substance abuse, and 
substance abuse increases the risk of trauma.


They may react to traumatic reminders (sounds, sights, smells 
associated with the emergency) with risky behaviors.


Students and young adults exposed to traumatic events may adopt a 
“live for today” attitude and be less focused on the future.
How to Help:


Be alert for possible dangerous behaviors among students.


Follow up with younger students who show an increase in visits to the nurse due to accidents and injuries.


Discuss the potential for an increase in risky behavior with students and staff, how it relates to the emergency 
and reminders, and the temporary need to be more careful for a few months after a crisis or disaster.


Discuss these risks with parents. Encourage them to temporarily increase supervision and set clear, firm 
limits on risky behaviors. 


Involve students in meaningful activities that have a tangible outcome, such as a project to help others in 
their community.


Encourage students and staff who have previously received treatment for substance abuse to seek 
additional support in the weeks and months following an emergency.

Helping with Sleep Problems 
Sleep difficulties are common following an emergency. People tend to stay on alert, which makes it hard to 
fall asleep and causes frequent awakenings during the night. Worrying about adversities and life changes 
can also make it hard to fall asleep. Disturbances in sleep can have a major effect on mood, concentration, 
decision-making, and risk for injury. Ask students and staff members about any trouble sleeping, sleep 
routines, and sleep-related habits. 
Problem-Solve Ways to Improve Sleep:


Go to sleep at the same time and get up at the same time each day.


Reduce alcohol consumption, as alcohol disrupts sleep.


Eliminate consumption of caffeinated beverages in the afternoon or evening.


Increase regular exercise, but not too close to bedtime.


Relax before bedtime by doing something calming, such as listening to 
soothing music, meditating or praying, or reading.


Limit daytime naps to 15 minutes and do not nap after 4 PM.
Other Things to Consider:


Encourage them to talk about and get support from others as worrying and reacting to reminders can 
disrupt sleep.


Enourage the individual to use calming strategies, such as breathing exercises, meditation, stretching, 
yoga, prayer, or listening to quiet music.


Talk to the student’s parents about how they can provide their child with additional support at night. For 
example, they could soothe their child, give more time to the nighttime routine, or practice the relaxation 
exercises at bedtime.
Caution: Teens and 
Adults
Avoid driving, 
physical labor, or 
activity—such as 
home repairs or 
cleaning up a park—
if you are sleeping 
poorly. Be extra 
careful when you are

Goal
To link students and staff with available services they need now or will need in the 
future
National Child Traumatic Stress Network    National Center for PTSD 
72
Core Action 8: Linkage with Collaborative Services
Provide Direct Link to Additional Needed Services
Identify which of the student’s, staff member’s, or family members’ needs and current concerns require 
additional information or services, and discuss with that person how to connect with these additional 
resources. Be aware of school policy about making referrals to outside resources and of existing links 
the school may have with outside agencies. Make sure you adhere to confidentiality laws and parental 
notification policies. Do what is necessary to ensure effective linkage with those services (walk the family 
over to a service agency representative, set up a meeting with a community representative who may provide 
appropriate referrals, or talk with the school representative who typically makes referrals for students). 
Examples of situations requiring a referral include:
•	 An acute medical problem that needs immediate attention
•	 An acute mental health problem that needs immediate attention
•	 Worsening of a preexisting medical, emotional, or behavioral problem
•	 Threat of harm to self or others
•	 Concerns related to alcohol or drug use
•	 Cases involving domestic, child, or elder abuse (be aware of reporting laws)
•	 When pastoral counseling is desired
•	 Ongoing difficulties with coping (four weeks or more after the event)
•	 Significant developmental concerns about children or adolescents
•	 When they ask for a referral
In addition, encourage families and staff to reconnect to agencies that provided services and support to them 
before the event, including: 


Mental health services


Medical services


Social support services


Child welfare services


Drug and alcohol support groups


Churches, synagogues, temples, mosques or other spiritual groups
When making a referral:


Give the person a brief summary of your understanding of his/her needs and concerns.


Check for the accuracy of your summary.


Describe the option of referral, including how this may help and what will take place if the individual goes 
for further help.


Ask about the person’s reaction to the suggested referral, and ask for permission to share information 
with the new provider.


Give written referral information or, if possible, make an appointment then and there.
Psychological First Aid for Schools Field Operations Guide
73
Core Action 8: Linkage with Collaborative Services


Ask for permission and/or a written release from the parent to share information with the professional 
receiving the referral.


Make sure that both a parent and the school are aware of your concern that a referral for continuing care 
may be warranted.


Recommend that any follow-up services for the family include (at least) a brief evaluation of child and 
adolescent adjustment.
Promote Continuity in Helping Relationships
As the recovery process continues, follow up with teachers and other staff members to monitor any significant 
emotional or behavioral reactions students may be displaying. Ensure that all staff members know the procedures 
for how and when to make a referral. Make sure a member of the counseling staff or a nurse is monitoring 
students’ attendance, nursing visits, academic performance, and disciplinary records to identify students who may 
be at-risk. It is always good practice to inform the individual who made the referral that you followed up with the 
referral. Finally, a member of the team should contact agencies with whom your school has preexisting mutual 
aid agreements and identify others to contact for additional services your school community requires for recovery. 
Meet with these agencies regularly to ensure that they are able to support the school community’s needs.
A secondary—but important—concern for many students and staff members is keeping in contact with responders 
who have been helpful. If you are an outside responder, you will not be able to have continuing contact with 
students and staff, as you will leave once the crisis is resolved. Fortunately, school personnel provide continuity 
and help protect against feelings of abandonment or rejection. You can create a sense of continuing care if you:


Emphasize the role of school personnel in providing immediate and ongoing support for students, and 
personally “hand off” students with whom you have worked to school personnel who will remain onsite.


Provide names and contact information for the local public health and public mental health service providers 
in the community. There may also be other local providers or agencies that have volunteered to provide 
post-disaster follow-up services for the community. (Be wary of referring to unknown volunteer providers.) 
Minimize the need for a student or staff member to retell his/her story, by sharing information with those who 
will have ongoing contact. Orient the new provider to what he/she needs to know about the person and, if 
possible, provide an introduction.
Putting PFA into Practice 
A student was badly injured in a bus accident and missed several days of school. When he returned, 
he had difficulty concentrating and completing his school work. His counselor recommended that he 
see a mental health professional, but he refused. The counselor addressed the student’s concerns 
and he agreed that it would make him feel better if the counselor talked to the psychologist first. The 
student’s parents agreed with this. When the counselor made contact, the parents agreed to have the first 
appointment at the school, with the counselor present, to help with the transition.
Spend extra time understanding an individual’s concerns about a referral, and problem-solve 
ways to ease the transition.
